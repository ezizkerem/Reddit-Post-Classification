PS5,I read about the faster loading times in greater memory space if you buy a good SSD. After doing my research I bought the fire cuda 530. When I opened it it's a thin chip rather than a thick box looking thing. Did Amazon accidentally send me the right item or is this just a new version of it? The picture on the item is the one that I see most of the time on YouTube tutorials but for some reason mine is just very thin. I've never done anything like this at the computer or a console so any help would be great,do I have the right ssd?

TLDR I accidentally purchased $40 of destruction allstar points because their shitty menu system has you defaulted to buy their season pass, which takes you to buy points if you don't have any, and if you happened to debugging your controller while not watching the screen doing this (while not having your account password required) you buy two $20 packs for a dead game in 2 seconds.

I've contacted support, escalated it, haven't spent any points, but was told to go away. Am I just shit out of luck?","Is there any possible way, outside of disputed charged, to get refund on virtual currency?"

I can also hear something kinda rubbing inside I think. The controller was fine last night, and it still works, but it's really annoying. I would open it up to see if something is in there, but i don't see anywhere to open it. I also rotated it for a good five minutes to see if whatever it was would loosen up or something, but the stick still feels rough. I have no clue what caused this, or how to fix it.

I wanted more details but as I was communicating in my non-native language, I was struggling to get more information. 

1. Is the repair guy accurate? Is my 1y 3m years old console dead? 
2. What are my options if he isn't accurate and there is chance of a repair?

PS5,"This seems like a big performance boost for Xbox Series X &amp; the Series S. I might be wrong about this. But this could mean that meme of a portable speaker/stove the Series S could be performing or out performing the PS5 with a similar or superior upscaled image with better anti aliasing. The Series X is already more powerful than the PS5. I can't even imagine the performance boost it's going to get. Maybe 60 fps 4k Upscaled Ray tracing ? It's definitely going to be hitting 120 fps easily. 

I remember seeing something about Xbox mentioning they would be using AMDs Graphics card full power or compatibility or something. Guessing they were probably hinting about FSR &amp; they knew Playstation weren't getting it somehow ? 

PlayStation might come out with a PS5 Pro with a compatible Graphics card if for some reason they can't enable it on the current PS5's hardware. Not sure if they just didn't pay the extra pennies to have full compatibility for their custom AMD graphics card or something. I know Xbox...well bank of mum &amp; dad Microsoft most likely paid for the full package &amp; probably extras.

Either way I'm happy for Xbox. I hope they do ridiculously well. Since fanboys and girls can't read between the lines. This is a good thing for us PlayStation gamers! This means PlayStation/Sony have to respond which is a win win for gamers. I stand by this. I think PlayStation/Sony have been slacking. Xbox right now can't really compete with the number of high quality exclusives PlayStation keep releasing. That's why they're buying up all these studios. They're also competing in other ways like Gamepass &amp; backwards compatibility (being able to pop in an og Xbox + Xbox 360 gen game &amp; have it work is impressive - I'm jelly ) &amp; those 60 fps frame boosts on games including old gen games like GTA 4 is also impressive. 

I know some people still haven't been able to get a PS5 and I've been lucky enough to have one since March 2021. But apart from the 60fps boosts in a few games. It's kinda been a little underwhelming for me. I'm still pissed they got rid of two of their best apps, Communities &amp; Live from PlayStation!!!! 😭 Once they got rid of those two things it was very clear to me PlayStation were definitely becoming more anticonsumer. 

Tried not to rant but it pisses me off how fanboys and fangirls give these companies a pass and blind loyalty. Then wonder why nothing significant is improving but getting worse. NPC behaviour.",Is FSR 2.0 coming to PS5 ? Or is it just for Xbox ?

PS5,"My PS5 has been blacking out every once in a while for a second or two before coming back on. For a while it’s okay but seemingly starts to build up and occur more frequently until it’s almost rapid. I usually take the cable and plug it in and out once it starts happening and it seems to alleviate the issue for a few hours, but idk if that’s just placebo. I’m using the HDMI cable provided by Sony. I’m playing on a 2K monitor instead of a TV but it does not have native downscaling so it streams in 1080p. It has HDR. I have another console in the same household using the official cable experiencing a similar issue, however this one is being played on a Samsung 4K TV.
I’ve tried researching the issue but it’s usually somebody using second-hand cables or an issue with 4K Transfer Rate. I’m beginning to wonder if the provided cables really are as high-quality as advertised, or at least consistently so.

Elden Ring looks more satisfying for the customization and gameplay challenge and depth; but I don't like how it ends and doesn't give you a reason to play long-term. 

While Valhalla looks more satisfying for the story, side activities, and settlement progression and longer gameplay. Although, I'm not sure if the character customization and combat are satisfying?

PS5,"Before I get too much hate here, note that my issues with Returnal don't stem from the fact that it's a roguelite. Roguelites (not to be confused with rogueLIKEs) are one of my favorite genres, having binged the hell out of Slay the Spire, Hades, Dead Cells, Dicey Dungeons and others. But having become a big fan of the genre, in large part because excellent game design is crucial for a good roguelite, I become pretty critical of games that fumble it. And I was extremely excited for the first AAA roguelite to hit. But this is... not it.

I feel there are a set of features that typically make for an excellent roguelite. Not all the greats have ALL of these down, but I feel they're generally hard to argue against:

1. A feeling of progression between runs.
2. Good variety of randomly generated level layouts.
3. Loot that adds lots of variety to the core gameplay and different ways to play, as well as interesting risk/reward mechanics.
4. Incentive to explore and experiment with different builds.
5. Ability to create powerful synergies between abilities in a run.

Not an exhaustive list by any means, but these are the sort of things I look for in a good roguelite. I would argue that my favorite roguelites I mentioned above do all five of these things well.

And I would argue that Returnal does almost every single one of them in either a mediocre or poor fashion. I've played about 15 hours and have struggled hard against the second biome's boss several times, and at this point I think I'm done.

First of all, if you're not great at shooters, it's very possible that Returnal will feel like bashing your head against a brick wall. The weapon proficiency mechanics, ether and item unlocks feel woefully insufficient to make me feel like I'm making any progress at all between runs unless I manage to progess to a new biome. 

Last night I had a friend who loves roguelites and enjoys shooters give it a shot, and he was shocked at just how hostile the game is to the player. While roguelites are meant to be hard, it feels to me that Returnal gives you very little to work with unless you want to invest a LOT of time trying the same things over and over, or exploring every nook and cranny of an area. Runs through the first biome frequently only grant limited variations of the starter pistol and maybe one other weapon, artifacts and stat augments are extremely rare, and lots of exploration feels discouraged if you don't have a great build because some rooms will have exteme difficulty spikes that'll have you dead in no time. Additionally, the risk/reward mechanics feel unbalanced as all hell - with very significant weight on the ""risk"" piece and not so much reward. Opening a highly malignant chest to get a one time use item that converts enemy projectiles into obelites? A parasite that gives you 30% off one shop item but two malfunctions when it detaches? That's not risk/reward, it's just... risk.

So exploring helps, but comes with a substantial struggle - while the first stage in many roguelites will feel easy for those who have gotten used to the game, exploring the first biome in Returnal remains pretty tough and risky even after 15 hours. But then if I skip right to the second biome as soon as I can in the beginning of the run, I don't have much of anything to turn the tide in that final boss fight. Don't get me wrong though - I've had plenty of tries exploring the first biome FULLY and still not having much of anything to help me in the second, but at least there's a chance. But having to spend 45 minutes exploring a level on EACH run just for a CHANCE of finding a couple good items does not make for good design, at all.

It's frustrating to me because Returnal's core gameplay is great, the story is interesting and the presentation, especially the audio and Dualsense, are absolutely top notch. But it's just not fun to keep playing the same areas and level layouts over and over and over again, having to fully explore this environment I've played dozens upon dozens of times in order to have any hope of progressing. This might be a case of ""get gud"", sure, but given my experience with roguelites I don't think the problem here is just me.","Returnal is a good shooter and a great showcase for the PS5 and Dualsense, but a pretty bad roguelite."

PS5,"I know for sure this was brought up times before, but I need to bring it up again. There were rumors how it's in the works, but they are just rumors for now.

As for the argument stating ""PS3 emulation is extremely difficult due to complexity of the cell processor"", I know. But this is a PS5. And a group of people managed to make a very good PS3 emulator for PC in their own free time, for free. Sony could easily just invest a lot more time and money into making a PS3 emulator on the PS5 (even PS2 and PS1), plus it's their own product, they're bound to have a lot more knowledge.

PSNow sucks because you have to pay monthly for a laggy and internet connection heavy service, to play games in 720p30FPS, in order to play select games, that isn't even available worldwide.

Emulation could easily boost the performance, resolution and remove input delay and not require us a constant stable internet connection, to pay monthly to play games you already have.",PSNow sucks and native PS3 emulation would be a lot better

PS5,"Hey

Recently got a ps5, I realize split screen is getting more and more rare these days however and I'm looking for decent games to play with friends.

Tried wcr 10 and it was a fun game but not a very interactive multilayer experience, got my eyes on Warhammer chaos bane as well, any other titles you guys can recommend? 

Fighting, rpg, shooter, racing - down for most genres it's more about how fleshed out the multilayer aspect is, preferably a ps5 remastered but ps4 works

Thanks",Tips on splitscreen games?
PS5,"I paid $588 at target for the Horizon Forbidden West bundle and when I opened the box I noticed there was no game so I figured it must be pre downloaded...nope, no game and I don't even know how to get the voucher as that isn't in the box either. Target got in contact with me after I tweeted about it and they said there are some options for me and that they know how disappointed I must be so I give them the order number and they tell me my options are return for a full refund or store credit...those are options I could've figured out on my own lol  So all in all I paid $50 dollars extra for a $20 voucher that I haven't received. It doesn't surprise me at all considering the greed of gaming companies but I did get a laugh out of it lol I couldn't imagine being a kid on Xmas and being scammed like that 😂","Beware the Horizon Forbidden West bundle, it doesn't come with the game just a coupon for $20 off"

PS5,"I'm trying to get a PS5, but the market in my area has few disc editions available in comparison to how many digital versions are available.

I'm willing to spend more for the disc version because I have it in my head I will save that money in the long term by buying used games.

I don't want to pay too much, but most of the disc editions the people are still asking way too much. I can find digital versions, some with an extra controller (which I could just sell), for retail price or a bit less than retail price. I'm not happy paying retail price for a used console but you still can't just walk into a store and buy a PS5, so it is what it is I guess.

I'm not willing to pay $90+ CAD for new games especially when I don't get a physical disc. Does the PS Store have decent sales like the PC market does? At this point, I pretty much only want a PS5 to play Demon's Souls, Returnal, TLOU1/2, Elden Ring, Horizon, maybe Miles Morales. Beyond that I don't really care. Since for the most part these are old games except Elden Ring I can likely find them used for a low price. I don't play multiplayer games, so I wouldn't be needing to get Playstation Plus, either. Although, I saw several of these games are included in the ""Extra"" subscription and $115/yr CAD doesn't seem too bad for that library of games.

Just wondering the community thoughts on this as I don't have much experience with playstation or their ecosystem. I'm used to buying games on sale all the time on PC, so when I see a new retail game for PS5 is $90 I'm just like what the hell. Yes, new releases are also $80 on PC but I never buy games right away, and often times from some other online stores like GMG they will have up to 20% discounts right from the getgo. Others 30-35% within a couple months.

So I'm just wondering how often games go on sale on PS Store I guess.",Does PS Store have decent sales?

PS5,"I just replayed TLOU2 recently, and after still loving it I dove back into old posts about it. I read a ton of hate on the story but noticed even the haters admitting the opposite for the gameplay.

The gameplay is really where it shines, from exploration in a non open world, I think the level design is top class. Looting is quick, controls are snappy, crafting is quick and not cumbersome, you have all heard the praise for this game dozens of times I am sure...

This brings me to my replay of RDR2. After finishing TLOU2, I needed another thing to play. I really want to save Stray for my wife and I together, and having PS+ Extra I decided, fuck it, I will play RD again.

Man. This game is a slog and a half to get through. I remember really being enamored by the world, the graphics, the systems, everything my first playthrough. I even remember the criticisms of it being slow, but I took it as a deliberate choice R* made to keep the game grounded. But after playing these two gaming behemoths back to back, I have to say these criticisms really ring true the second time. Holding x to ride a horse next to a person for 10 minutes, to shoot a wolf, just to ride a horse for 10 minutes again is not fun. Holding square to loot EVERY ITEM is cumbersome. Holding triangle sometimes to interact, but then holding square to interact is a confusing choice. I just cannot believe how much of a 180 I am experiencing on this game my second time through. To be honest, I might just stop with it and move on to something different.

TLDR: RDR2 was one of my favorite games in 2018, and in 2022 I can't make it past the first chapter.

# Sony Gaming Unit Adds Uber Antitrust Lawyer Amid Expansion Plans

 

Sony Interactive Entertainment Corp. has hired a new top antitrust and public policy lawyer in Gregory McCurdy, who held a similar position at Uber Technologies Inc.

McCurdy, Sony’s new senior director for competition and regulatory affairs, arrives as the company’s gaming subsidiary recently made a key acquisition and scuttled an antitrust class action. He left Uber last month, shortly before the ridesharing giant’s former top European lobbyist [leaked a trove](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/uber-lobbied-politicians-broke-laws-in-global-push-reports-1) of company documents.

A Sony spokesperson confirmed McCurdy’s hire, which he announced in a recent [message posted](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6944667545744396289/) to his LinkedIn profile.

“The world of video games is fascinating and will be a great new adventure for me,” McCurdy said via LinkedIn. He [spent](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/document/X8I38LVK000000) more than 15 years as a senior litigation and policy lawyer for Microsoft Corp. prior to joining Uber in 2015. “I know it a bit from my Microsoft days when Xbox launched to compete with PlayStation,” McCurdy said.

His senior director role at Sony is a [new one](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6899419008320311297/), per an [online posting](https://jobsearcher.com/j/senior-director-competition-regulatory-affairs-at-playstation-global-in-washington-dc-rvW8V97) for the job. The posting said the person filling the role would would become a “senior level member” of the PlayStation video game console maker’s global legal leadership and “primary competition and regulatory counsel” for the company’s business worldwide.

McCurdy didn’t respond to a request for comment. Nor did Stephanie Burns, who [joined Sony last year](https://www.sie.com/en/blog/sie-leadership-spotlight-stephanie-burns/) as legal chief for its San Mateo, Calif.-based gaming unit.

That business includes PlayStation and the video game company Bungie Inc., whose [$3.6 billion sale to Sony](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/mergers-and-acquisitions/sony-buys-destiny-game-developer-bungie-for-3-6-billion) closed earlier this month. Sony reportedly has plans to [turn](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-02-04/sony-s-plan-with-video-game-studio-bungie-is-a-subscription-service) Bungie into a [subscription service](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/playstation-plans-new-service-to-take-on-xbox-game-pass) for video games.

Sony and its lawyers from Shearman &amp; Sterling also scored a win this week by convincing a federal judge in California to [dismiss a putative class action](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/antitrust/sony-gets-court-to-toss-video-gamers-playstation-antitrust-suit) accusing its PlayStation store of [anti-competitive practices](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/sony-sued-for-limiting-purchases-of-games-to-playstation-store). McCurdy, a former co-chair of the American Bar Association’s antitrust committee, is well-versed on such issues.

At Uber, he led a team handling US antitrust litigation and merger clearance proceedings. McCurdy was also previously Microsoft’s [first antitrust litigator](https://www.concurrences.com/en/auteur/greg-mccurdy) in Europe, where he spent eight years managing antitrust proceedings before the European Commission in Brussels and appeals to courts in Luxembourg.

## Uber’s Influence

McCurdy initially co-led an Uber group that provided advice on legislative, legal, and transportation policy matters to the ridesharing giant’s government relations and communications teams during a critical time in the company’s growth cycle, according to online biographical materials.

That work included counseling Uber in its “dealings with state and municipal governments and airport authorities who are all active in regulating taxi and for-hire vehicle services,” said a description of McCurdy’s duties on his LinkedIn profile. “These issues are key to Uber’s rapid growth and innovation in hundreds of jurisdictions in the US and around the world.”

Uber’s efforts to [influence government authorities](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/uber-lyft-influencers-find-democratic-allies-toughest-to-sway) as it expanded globally between 2013 and 2017 were the subject of the “[Uber Files](https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/),” a collection of 124,000 corporate records turned over to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists by former company lobbyist [Mark MacGann](https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/uber-lobbyist-whistleblower-mark-macgann/).

The leaked files [outline the tactics](https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/uber-global-rise-lobbying-violence-technology/) that Uber used to expand into new markets by recruiting politicians and implementing [aggressive measures](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/ubers-greyball-draws-ire-for-blocking-government-stings) to thwart regulators and law enforcement bodies. Uber acknowledged past mistakes in a [statement](https://www.uber.com/newsroom/icij-statement/).

A spokeswoman for Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick, who [resigned in 2017](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/uber-ceo-kalanick-relinquishes-power-after-investor-mutiny) as Uber’s top executive and is [now hiring lawyers](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/travis-kalanicks-real-estate-startup-looking-for-legal-talent) for his real estate startup, issued a separate [statement](https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/statement-travis-kalanick/) denying that he acted inappropriately or directed illegal actions.

“The reality was that Uber’s expansion initiatives were led by over a hundred leaders in dozens of countries around the world and at all times under the direct oversight and with the full approval of Uber’s robust legal, policy, and compliance groups,” said Kalanick’s spokeswoman, Devon Spurgeon.

Salle Yoo, Uber’s top lawyer until she [left the company](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/ubers-legal-chief-is-said-to-depart-as-ceo-sets-new-course) in 2017 following Kalanick’s ouster, said in a statement that “we developed systems to ensure the company acted ethically and consistent with the law in the countries where we operated.”

Yoo sold off [millions in Uber stock](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/document/X20GV9BK000000) after leaving the company. She resurfaced last year at IonQ Inc., a quantum computing outfit she [joined as legal chief](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/ubers-ex-legal-chief-joins-quantum-computing-company-ionq) as it prepared to go public. An IonQ spokeswoman confirmed that Yoo has since left the company, which hired a [new top lawyer](https://ionq.com/posts/march-28-2022-ionq-welcomes-laurie-babinski-anant-sanchetee) in March.",Sony Gaming Unit Adds Uber Antitrust Lawyer Amid Expansion Plans

PS5,"Hello all, just looking for some guidance in case anyone here has had a similar situation. Someone forced their way inside my house while I was gone for about 20 minutes and took my PS5 right from my room, among other things. I searched and saw plenty of people who had theirs stolen during delivery but I’m assuming in that case you would just get refunded or a new console. 

I had mine for over a year and a half. There were multiple accounts logged in and of course card information attached. I already called PS Support, and the lady I spoke to didn’t really seem like she knew anything. Ultimately she walked me through deactivating the console online and I did but I’m not sure if that did anything past just logging me out. Can anyone confirm what happens when you deactivate remotely? 

I’ve also seen where a few people have said Sony could brick it if I provided the console information but again, the lady I spoke with was unhelpful in that regard. And when I reached out to their support page on twitter they just redirected me to some isp request website. 

I figure this is a long shot but can I get it tracked? I’m pretty sure it was someone in my neighborhood who was watching the house. 

Any advice or tips is greatly appreciated. Sorry if this should’ve been posted elsewhere.",House burglarized and PS5 stolen. Any chance at tracking or getting it remotely bricked?

PS5,"I'd like to lead with I personally find the $70 price tag a bit high, but here is an example of consumer/corporation mindset as to why it is priced this way.

I buy a new car for $60000. It is top of the line, with all the new features, safety, tech etc. I love this car, it gets me where I need to go and continues to work well even 10 years after I bought it.

A new model is released (usually this would be yearly, but for the sake of this discussion lets keep it at a decade) and is now priced at 70000 due to inflation, with many of the new features and improvements that were seen in the automotive industry over the past 10 years. I love the look and feel of this new car, but can't justify the upgrade because my old one is working well. I might be able to sell/trade in the old car for a fraction of what I bought it for, but the difference is still not worth it. I decide to not buy the new car.

Do I get angry at the manufacturers? Do I demand a cheaper upgrade because I am an existing customer? Do I tweet the company making the car saying that they are cheating customers out of money because thet could just buy a car like mine for cheaper? Do I get upset because this new car doesn't have all the features I personally want? Do I yell at those who want to buy the new car either because they don't have the car, or are looking to  try the upgrade themselves?

The answer should be no, because while this car is still a great product - it isn't for me. It is for those who want the new car. Who are looking to drive this car for the first time, or to buy a brand new model to take for a spin.

It's ok to not want the new thing, or for a new thing to not be made specifically for you. It's ok to think something is too expensive for you right now and to wait for a sale. It's ok.",The Last of Us Part 1 - and buying a new car

I played the supposedly updated PS5 version and while the frame rate was nicer, the resolution dropped to like 720P and there’s also The Crew 2’s shitty handling model in general due to the game engine and them doing too much with the other disciplines (plane and boat). NFS Heat is dead, HP Remastered basically came out 12 years ago, and I never could get into NFS 2015 with it’s always rainy night time environment

But to be honest, I kind of feel that the haptic triggers kind of suck. I tried using it on ghost runner for example and after about 30 minutes I had to turn it off completely because my fingers where starting to hurt. I also have to turn them off for shooters because they are a liability.  Maybe it is the implementation of haptic triggers that suck right now, but for the time being, I will keep them off.",The haptic triggers are a gimmick and kind of suck

The graphics still look good, the gameplay is rough especially in AC2 but its still serviceable and the characters are top notch. I also booted up Black Flag and played it for 3 hours and man I instantly got reminded why it is my favorite AC game- the parkour is improved, Edward himself is a character on par with Ezio/Altair. The supporting cast is the best in any AC game even beating Ezio games. The ship combat is still awesome and the game graphics are still eye pleasing. I stopped BF in favor of playing Ezio games first as I plan to replay the Ezio/Altair saga first and then the Kenway Saga.  Now only if Ubi patch these games to 60fps on ps5.

PS5,Is there a list of what games premium has over extra. I can upgrade to Extra for £13.60 or Premium for £20 so not much difference either way,I cant find an easy list of what games Premium gives you over Extra?
PS5,"So I just got a PS5. Redeemed close to 600 dollars on PSN credit through multiple rewards sources and bought a lot of games over the last 10 days with an extra 200 dollars of my own money. I bought games on sale, that are now on sale cheaper or with extra DLC in new bundles on in the summer sale, all within the last 10 days. Sony has a 14 day and no download policy for refunds. None of my games were downloaded. I reached out to their support with 11 games I wanted to refund, so I can repurchase them at their new cheaper rate. Would save me about 45 dollars in the long run. 

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted their customer support and they refunded one game. I told them I had 10 more, and the support stuff ended the chat. I contacted them again, they told me they would honor 6 but moving forward I can't refund anymore in general? WTF? I spent 800 dollars on games, and you want to limit me after I try to save 45 dollars? 

&amp;#x200B;

So there is that, then there is their atrocious store itself that I guess has individual listings for separate versions of games as their own version, even though it's the same game and it's hard to figure out what you want unless you design your own spreadsheet.  For example, I own both Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy. But the bundle on the store for both games is available to purchase. Other examples are I own Devil May Cry 4, but can't buy the complete collection with includes DMC and 1-3, which would save me money. I can't purchase that bundle because I own DMC 4, which is annoying. I purchased Arkham Knight Premium Edition for 8 dollars 10 days ago, and now the complete Arkham Collection is on sale for 8.99, and I can't purchase it and Sony won't return the game. Where Steam shows everything you own and normally gives you discount on bundles for already owing stuff in it.",I have to vent about how terrible the PSN Store and Sony Support is

Luckily didn't damage anything around it. I called sony, and was within warranty, they are sending me a refurbished ps5 that they have repaired in exchange for my broken one.

I called again today to ask if they could provide me with the details of what went wrong with my previous console, having not received the refurbished one yet, but they refused. Apparently, they don't typically explain issues but considering that the issue could have caused damage to my other belongings, I feel like I deserve to know what went wrong.

Everyone I've spoken to has said that it is in my 'consumer rights' to know exactly what went wrong with the console.

At the end of the day, I'm just a teenager who has worked their holidays away, I've already worked hard enough for my PS5, but I want to know what went wrong with my first one, given I treated it perfectly.

PS5,"PlayStation 5 has just offered a great gaming experience over the past year for me. A great, consistent 60fps for games that support the higher fps, and dynamic resolutions I honestly can’t tell apart other than just looking so good on a 4K screen. 

But, with the console being backwards compatible with every PS4 game and PS5 games that offer fidelity mode, the 30fps the PlayStation provides looks very choppy. Almost unplayable. I’m sure these kinds of concerns have shown up before. But, I just need to hear some thoughts.

I’m sure one commons idea is that getting a taste of 60fps kind of destroys 30fps forever. However, I have a personal experience that contradicts that. I played a game on both PS4 and PS5 just to compare, with the game running on PS5 having the locked frame rate at 30. It was The Evil Within 2. The experience I came out with was that the PS4 running the game at 30fps looked significantly smoother than the PS5 running the game at 30fps. The PS5 ran 30fps very choppy. I tried adjusting motion blur options to see if that’s what the difference was, but the PS5 version felt worse minus the better resolution. And it doesn’t just stop at The Evil Within 2.

Games locked at 30fps seem to look and feel better on a PS4 than they do on a PS5, and I don’t know why. Is it just my PS5? 

Does it have something to do with how the PS5 handles software? I’ve heard of something called frame pacing. I don’t know what that is, but apparently it’s makes a big difference regardless if the frame rates being compared are the same.

I just wanted to check in with the community.",Why does 30fps look choppy on PS5?

I bit the bullet, and bought an Elite Series 2. I saw the issues other people were having, and still got it. Issues only happen to the ""other guy"". 

Well, I got it, and right out of the box, the stick drift (left-right) on my left joystick is worse than my 8 year old Xbox 1 controller. The center part of the movement area left to right has a large area where it isn''t taking pressure to move it, A.K.A drift.

I sent it to Microsoft looking to get a refurbished one, but I got back my same controller, it legitimately re-synced to my console when I pressed the power button. What am I to do in this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot return it because Microsoft considerers it a ""Deal""/""Package"" with the series X that I bought at the same time. If I want to return the controller, I have to return the console as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am good at repairing things, so is it worth taking apart to repair it? Are there any warranties that I am voiding by doing so?

&amp;#x200B;

If the Virtuoso is not what I should shoot for, is there any other headset that I can get surround with all my consoles?  Or is the only way to get Atmos and surround on Xbox is to buy a headset made specifically for Xbox?

I've had the XSX since pretty much release day, I was happy but got too greedy and thought having a gaming PC would be alot better (yes it was for sure)... 

My $3,800 gaming PC (had it for 1/12 years) literally just failed on me. Its broken. No way of me fixing it, nor is there any warranty from the company.  So I've accepted it that's pretty much 4K down the drain.

Anyways. My point is... That console is so much better than PC's, yes PC can get you better graphics / performance and other amazing benefits but having to worry all the time about whether the PC is going to break anytime soon or come a couple years time and it's time to upgrade your CPU / graphic cards for so much money it's ridiculous. Whereas with Consoles you're set for a good 8-10 years and with the direction that consoles are going, I wouldn't be surprised if we overtake PC ( impossible I know but who knows lol)

I generally enjoy both consoles a lot and feel they both are good in there respective areas. I do admit I like the concept troller and UI on PS5 more, but I enjoy a lot of features on Xbox as well. I just don’t know where to get third party titles. I’ve noticed on sites like Digital Foundry they go back and forth and it depends on the game where it’s best played, but I have noticed the last few ones have favored the Xbox more.

So I turned on the console by pushing the power button on the console. It went on for 1-2 second and immediately shut down by itself. I powered it on again, this time it kept staying on, but on my TV it says no HDMI Signal. Also the controller doesn’t pair anymore. I made sure no Disc was inserted, tried another HDMI cable, tried different ports on my TV, I performed different steps to reset the video resolution and the console, but nothing helped.

XboxSeriesX,"Full disclosure here, I own both a PS5 and Series X, and I actually got my Series X first yet I play it way less than my PS5. We're talking MAYBE 4 months worth of actual gameplay on the Series X.

Right out of the box I remember the Xbox controller feeling like a cheap, plastic piece of crap. It honestly felt *worse* to hold and use than the controller that came with the Xbox One. Anyone agree?

So after the 4 months worth of usage on the controller I'm ALREADY having problems. For one, whenever I navigate menus, especially the Xbox home screen menu, if I just push the left stick (or even press the d-pad once) it will RAPIDLY skip over menu options. Like if I'm looking at my games library and push down on left stick real quick, one time, you'd think it would go down just once, right? Nah. It jumps like 3 times. Not sure if this is a controller issue or just the Xbox being stupid. Neither would surprise me.

The second, and bigger issue, is RANDOM right stick drift. And when I say random I do mean random. I mean, some days I'll go to play and the issue won't be there at all. Everything will be fine. Then the next day I'll go to play and no matter what game I play as soon as I take my thumb off the right stick it drifts upwards, causing characters in games to just, you know, LOOK UP. 

WHY is this happening? How is this happening? Is it software or hardware related? Is the Xbox really THIS big of a POS that the controller is failing after 4 months of casual gameplay? And no, I don't throw my controllers or anything. It may have dropped from my chair like once or twice. You know, shit happens. But *that* shouldn't cripple a controller.

In comparison, the PS5 controller (that I've played WAY more on) is still fine. And we're talking about a controller that allows games to set pressure sensitivity in the triggers and sometimes you just squeeze those bitches so hard in the middle of a game you feel like you're break them. But nope, still fine. Hell, while we're on the subject I also have an Oculus 2 and I've dropped those controllers a ton of times. I remember slamming the right one in to a wall once on accident. Hurt my hand and put an indent in the drywall, but the controller was perfectly fine.

I shouldn't be having any issues with a $500 console that I rarely play this early on.

XboxSeriesX,"I spent sometime today reading reviews on the XBOX store mainly getting linked from Gamepass.   I'm curious if the reviews are only from console players or if it's a mix of PC players as well.  

I'll notice, even on games I've played and beaten some user reviews major complaints about a game will be due to bugs or saying the game feels unfinished.  I Personally never ran into any bugs worth mentioning in some of the games others are giving one star due to their buggy experience.  Now I do not and never have played on PC so this just as thought I had and I'm curious if maybe it could be a lackluster PC they're using? Can something like a terribly optimized PC cause the bugs or if it is the game the poor PC just makes them more noticeable?

I just find it strange how some games get these terrible reviews due to a buggy gameplay experience but I played the same games at launch and never experienced this myself.",Question about user reviews on the XBOX store
XboxSeriesX,Basically had to cancel an order through Microsoft store because they said they had shipping issues. Paid for expedited shipping but they said it may take until the beginning of spetember so I refunded. Also can't send my current controller in for repair under warranty because customer service said the same issues apply and it may take a few months to get it back. I assume buying through Amazon/gamestop with present the same issue because it will coke directly from the warehouse and xbox doesn't feel like getting there shit together anyone have any ideas on where to get a new one without the shit customer service?,does anyone know where to buy a new controller online that will arrive on time?

XboxSeriesX,"I feel like this game could greatly benefit from being on Game Pass. I tried it out this past year and was totally lost to everything in the game, it’s kind of overwhelming going on. But this past week I decided to rent it from Game Fly again, and I have a buddy who’s been showing me the ropes. It’s so much more enjoyable when you take the time to learn it and have people helping you out. 

The basis of the game is you’re a monster/bounty hunter. You can go into a match solo, duo, or trios. And the goal is to find the monster lair clues, track it down, and kill it. When you kill it, you have to take the bounty token to extraction and make it out alive. All the while there are enemy player hunters doing the same thing. And I can’t express how intense the engagements can get. It’s some of the most satisfying pvp fights I’ve ever been in. Imagine being in or around the boss room, and you hear a pack of crows go off bc another set of players spooked them. Or a pack of dogs start barking, and you know another team is closing in. Now you gotta decide to go fight the boss or handle the enemy team coming in. What if you do kill the boss? Do you high tail it to extraction or duke it out with the other hunters? It’s really intense! 

The problem with the game is you can literally go down in like 2 bullets. The game is hella unforgiving and makes it tough for new players to come in and learn unless you have someone helping you. I was fortunate to have a friend who plays teach me, but it’s really not as complicated as you may expect. 

Something I found was confusing at first was the in game economy and guns and hunters situation. You really don’t have to spend a penny on the game. Everything you can buy with real money is purely cosmetic. But if you want a cool looking variant of a gun or a cool looking hunter you can spend a couple of bucks on the game. 

I feel like this game has a solid player base. I have no issues getting games. But I feel like this is a good game to be on game pass. Even if it was free to play, I could see it still doing good and being in the same league as Apex, and all the other battle royal kinda like games. I mean this game is PVE/PVP, but. 

The game is currently on sale for $10 on the Xbox Store. If you’re looking for a good pvp with really intense firefights, and some good pve monster and boss fights, pick it up. It’s so good! I’m glad I gave it another chance. I just feel like people are scared to go in on it bc of how unforgiving it can be, and it’s not free to play like other games of its kind.","Hunt Showdown is currently on sale for $10, and I feel like it deserves a higher praise and attention. It would be a great addition to game pass."

I thought maybe it was just the games themselves. my friends want me to play destiny 2 with them here and there and that game sucks, so I figured the constant crashing was just the game because sense when has destiny ever worked as intended. but through out the months ive owned it more and more games just started crashing. 


borderlands, warframe, aliens fireteam, back for blood, castle crashers, devil may cry, cyberpunk, and probably others that I cant think of. but just now I was playing halo 3 on mcc and my game froze mid turn then hard crashed. then I logged back on and got banned. so that's awesome. has this been a problem for other people as well? I know they've had alot of issues making them consistently when it launched and still do so I didn't expect to go without some problems. but I figured this would be fixed with updates overtime. now I think I just have a faulty console. that would explain why i also haven't been able to update the store for like 5 months either. it always has to update then it hits 99% and never finishes. but is this a common issue that can be fixed myself? or is this something Microsoft has to fix?",so many games just freeze or crash.

XboxSeriesX,"Not much time left due to a medical condition and would like to enjoy some time.

My friends true colors have shown once I shared the news.

So I’m just looking for people that would be playing around these times. Figured asking 33 million on Reddit is faster than an Xbox post a day to maybe 50 people about 1 game. 

Sure I can meet randoms again and make another group. But finding 4 people to play at a certain time that are all open to different games would be very difficult. Then to find a shit load of people to play any game i choose would be even harder and it would take up TIME I do NOT have. I’ve done that over the years and I’ve gotten 2 solid groups but then someone moves, gets married, etc.

I finally feel good after all my workouts between 9pm central time to whenever.  I would Like to go to bed at 1-2 to repeat my process but if I’m enjoying a good time I’m staying up to enjoy that.

I have any system and will play almost any game. Games the group Of 4 of us had played the last 2 years before we slowly lost members would of been,
Apex, rainbow, PUBG, battlefront 2, aliens, dwarf miner game with creatures, fortnite, sniper 5, TMNT, gt5, GT7, fall guys, far cry, red dead online, tarkov, Warcraft. I’ll play anytibg from indie to AAA. 

If someone just wants to stream and chat. Where I don’t even play I just watch and tlak while i do my workouts. As it gives me motivation to push through that pain. 
Sure I can watch YouTubers but when it’s less people and you can personally talk to them it’s different.

XboxSeriesX,"So I’m on a COD kick right now, I’m trying to complete as much as I can on each of the titles. There’s been an ongoing trend of - for example, I need to pick up 46 pieces of intel, I pick up all of them but the game only registered 45, so normally I just go delete all the save data a restart the game fresh, the work around seems to be that once you pick up the 1st intel on the fresh game start, it’s counts towards the 46th, and unlocks the achievement. 

So I’ve put down as much COD MW3 as I could before I noticed things were not registering, literally nothing is registering, from the collection type challenges to the challenges like shooting down a certain amount of helicopters with a grenade launcher. 

I went through every step possible, I swear every combination of suggestions…

Completely deleted the save data using the 360 interface.

Completely deleting from the Series X interface.

Deleting the reserved space.

Deleting the local 360 storage.

Deleting the local saved games.

I uninstalled  the game and reinstalled it.

I have tried going offline.

I’ve tried a hard reset.

I’ve tried all of the above in different combinations.

I’ve tried all of the steps that I can find or think of, however, when I’m hopeful that the game will load up a fresh new start, like it’s the 1st time it’s ever been fired up, there it is …. 100% on the single player campaign, all of my collectibles are accounted for and no achievements are working.

I played COD MW Remastered, I had similar issues, but was able to delete the files from “everywhere” and start a fresh game, then I played MW2 Remastered, same issues, again I was able to delete files and start fresh. Keeping in mind COD MW 1 &amp; 2 Remastered were made with the newer consoles in mind, now COD MW3 is a physical 360 disc, I wonder if it has to do with actual 360 games vs. newer titles?

So I’m at a lose, I’m kind of bummed that I can’t progress any further on anymore challenges or achievements. 

I’m hopeful that someone might have a solution to my issue if I explained it enough to make sense. And I read the rules of the sub Reddit,  I hope the doesn’t fall under the “no tech or support post” rule, if it does I apologize, please suggest a more appropriate sub Reddit.

XboxSeriesX,"So, I’m very lucky to have got a Series X last year, so I’ve been playing that pretty exclusively.

I’m now setting up my study now we’ve moved into a new house, the Series X is staying downstairs in the lounge, but the study is going to be a room where I can play Xbox if the wife (who’s a avid gamer like me) or kids are playing a game downstairs, or vice versa. The room will have a fairly basic 43in TV in there, so graphical performance isn’t top tier. 

So I was thinking about putting my old XB1S to use. I have a few options so wanted some opinions. 

Do I…..

A) Upgrade the One S with a new fan as the old one is high pitched with age, replace the HDD with a SSD, not so much for speed but because the old drive is becoming louder and louder. This would be the only Xbox in that room.

B) Get a Series S, and sell/donate the One S.

C) Get a Series S and just replace the fan of the One S, using that for physical games/movies that I can’t play on Series S, while using the Series S for digital games or games that can effectively use the extra power. 

Really I can see both sides of the fence, and since this is a opportunity to use a space for work and for gaming, I think it’s well worth using it. What do you think?",Is it worth putting my old Xbox to work?

Now I don’t abuse my controller but it’s safe to say I dropped it a good bit of times. 2) The grip is still holding pretty strong no signs of grip loss. 3) The button remapping is top of the line.

Now lets start with the bad, which is very few. 
1) The ergonomics of the controller isnt very quite what I prefer because playing FPS, I shoot with the bumpers rather then the triggers (ps3 cod shooting buttons). 2) The QC in regards of how it held over time, every online review is true, in regards of bumper and stick drifts.

The should be challenging but not too hard because I mostly have about an hour and I don’t want to get frustrated in that time.

I personally wish they would reactivate LIVE on the 360 again and put most older games for the SX in the MS store or in gamepass and people with a SX or 360 collectors are both able to play online again. This would boost sales both in the MS store and gamepass and a profit for developers.

I have seen that most of the options offer 4K30 for high quality or dynamic 1440-4K/60 for performance.    
and it made me wonder what happen when u plug it to a 1440P monitor:  
lets say that we have a game that try to do 4K60 but drop to 50ish FPS often, will it stop doing it at 1440P ? or the game run at 4K but scale down to 1440P and will suffer from the same FPS drops ?

Nintendo always makes fun takes on real life sports (Olympics, tennis, golf, football etc) and have seen success.

It gives The Coalition and/or a secondary studio to play around with Unreal 5 without making a full blown game. Think about when Rockstar made Table Tennis.

And rightly so. The art style, the music, the characters, the platforming. Everything feels so tight and polished.

Even though I only went back to the 360 version to grab the online achievements before the servers shut down, I've found myself playing through a bunch more levels than I need to just because the game is such a pleasure to play!

I even dusted off the Xbox One version (yes, I own both versions) just to catch up with the progress I've made on the 360.",Rayman Legends is one of the greatest platformers in gaming history.

XboxSeriesX,"Finally finished this story...and what?! I did the Deathwish story ending. I had a feeling this was the final mission, but wasn't certain. After completing it, and having that touching moment at the end, I felt totally unsatisfied. 

This game felt like a bunch of missions that weren't that rewarding or even cohesive. But definitely not that rewarding, to play, or complete. Maybe they focused too much on side missions, the dog, and random muggings on the street. None of that interested me that much, nor did do much of that stuff.

GTA IV is definitely still my favorite. I'd rather they bring back the single protagonist, with a larger story.

**Any idea if new ones would last longer or keep the vibration going until it's time to charge again?**

The only 2 things I don't like about these batteries is they take 8+ hours to charge 4 and the vibration stops after a few days.

XboxSeriesX,"My Xbox has played fine, but I started playing RE2 Remake and it seemed like it really struggled to process it. Crazy loud fan, got really hot, then shut down. To be clear, my Xbox has 100% no ventilation problems or dust on it, so this would mean the system is flawed to overheat.

Ever since this, my Xbox shuts off within 5 minutes of turning on. It can’t actually be shutting down for heat issues because it’s not hot to touch, and there hasn’t been time for it to heat.

I’ve tried every possible troubleshooting step recommended, including a hard reset, with no luck. My one year warranty expired a few months ago. Xbox is offering to repair it for $300, so essentially telling me to buy a new console because they gave me a junker.

XboxSeriesX,"[Microsoft Buys Rare](https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/24/microsoft-buys-rare)

I was just thinking to myself why Microsoft bought Rare back in 2002 but i can’t really find a good reason when searching online. 

The article does mention this: 

“The new deal between Rare and Microsoft will yield five games over the next two years and included among those will be Kameo, Perfect Dark 2 and games from the racing, platformer and shooting categories.“

So maybe MS acquired Rare simply to make more console exclusives or is there perhaps more to this story and how seemingly Rare never really lived up to the standards that MS might have been hoping for since Rare hasn’t made that many good games after this acquisition happened. 

I am also curious if someone that has since left MS has ever talked about this deal and why MS was willing to spend  $375 million for this Studio.",Why did Microsoft Acquire Rare back in 2002?

Last Thursday, 7/14, I finally got my invitation to buy an Xbox Series X! I was so excited, and I even got a gift card for signing up for the Prime Card, effectively making the device $150 cheaper for me.

Order was expected to be delivered next day, by Sunday the shipment is marked as lost by Amazon Logistics as it is being shipped directly by Amazon. Well, fast forward to today after it was rescheduled and the order was cancelled.

I called customer service and they were able to get me a quick refund but the issue is, I now have no way of getting the console without another invitation and who knows how long that will take?

I am just frustrated and furious and went back and forth with customer service about escalating this issue, perhaps getting an expedited invitation all to an avail, and I wasn't too hard on the CS rep, they can only do so much, but what do I do now? I have over $500 is Amazon gift cards and can't even buy an Xbox right now!",Amazon cancelled Xbox order and I have to wait for an invitation again!
XboxSeriesX,,hands up who is guilty of this??
XboxSeriesX,"I got the Xbox series X February 2021, as soon as I could considering how hard they were to get a hold of. I’ve owned every other Xbox console and never had any problems with them but since getting the series X it’s been nothing but.

First, my controller came faulty the right trigger felt a bit weird and after a week or so starting sticking. So I sent that back and got a replacement under the warranty at no cost to me.

Secondly, my Xbox stopped reading discs. Turns out it was a common problem with the new console and so I had to send that back. Bear in mind it’s not an easy thing to package the console without the original box especially as you don’t want it damaged during transit, I had to buy a box big enough for it and bubble wrap. So I sent that back and got a replacement as it was still under warranty.

Lastly, the controller that I had replaced originally the right bumper broke so the controller is basically unusable for gaming. It’s not under warranty anymore so I’m going to have to pay for a replacement.

I’ve only ever had Xbox consoles and I have never had a problem with any of the previous, the fact I’ve had so many problems with this generation within the first 18 months is seriously disappointing.",Disappointing experience with Xbox Series X. Wasn’t expecting hardware issues.

XboxSeriesX,"I have had my my Xbox one gen 1 for nearly 7-8 years and have 1tb of internal storage and about 2/3 of a 2tb external hard drive full with 30+ games. When I got my Xbox series x about half a year back, I only wanted to fill it up with new and series x optimised games and didn’t want to plug an external hard drive in as this could lower performance, and the sea gate internal expansions are just too expensive and I don’t have enough internal storage to transfer all the stuff from one to the other. But I do want to download some games that are already on my Xbox one  that have recently been optimised for series x.

## Critic Reviews

[**Checkpoint Gaming**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/563/checkpoint-gaming) \- [Victor Tan](https://opencritic.com/critic/9220/victor-tan) \- [8 / 10](https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2022/07/as-dusk-falls-review-a-serious-look-at-consequences)

&gt;As Dusk Falls tells a wonderful story that is not only thought provoking, but willing to discuss difficult subjects that aren’t often talked about. With every decision having an impact and putting the focus on characters, the story themes are effectively communicated and make you interested in seeing what happens next. Experiencing the game with your friends is also enjoyable, fostering discussions of your choices and what kind of decisions you make. While getting 100% completion for the game can be a tough journey, you are rewarded with story details that open up character motivations and keep you thinking about the characters long after you put down the game.

[**Dexerto**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto) \- [Sam Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/9291/sam-smith) \- [8.5 / 10](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/as-dusk-falls-review-1874621/)

&gt;As Dusk Falls is a stellar first attempt from Interior Night and a must-play for those who enjoy interactive narrative games like The Quarry, Heavy Rain, and Detroit: Become Human. In many ways, the game feels like a playable season of Fargo and even channels other gritty crime dramas like Breaking Bad at times. Essentially, it's a playable binge drama, but one that can be enjoyed time and time again, with different endings and twists, depending on your choices.  
&gt;  
&gt;As Dusk Falls will make you hurt, and it will make you cry, but it won't let you down.

[**Digital Trends**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/124/digital-trends) \- [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) \- [3.5 / 5 ](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/as-dusk-falls-review-xbox-series-x/)

&gt;As Dusk Falls is an atypical narrative adventure game with a compelling story about family.

[**EGM**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/38/egm) \- [Michael Goroff](https://opencritic.com/critic/4103/michael-goroff) \- [4 / 5 ](https://egmnow.com/as-dusk-falls-review/)

&gt;As Dusk Falls is exciting,  beautiful, and heavy-handed. Its more streamlined approach to narrative gameplay and its less traditional art style create an immersive experience that engages with the player's imagination. That it can work both as a morally challenging single-player story and a party game for multiple players speaks to the confidence that its developers have. But its second half of the story undercuts some of the tension that its excellent first half builds, and a terrible cliffhanger might leave you feeling betrayed.

&gt;So overall, is As Dusk Falls worth it? It has a captivating story with more than a few rocky moments, but is as close to feeling “genre” as it can get. It also has a lot of shortcomings that might only be saved by the interesting multiplayer features. It’s the perfect game to pull out for any digital or physical get-togethers, but is otherwise a reminder of wasted potential.

&gt;We have a lot of gripes about As Dusk Falls, but we’ve still very much enjoyed our time with it. Its story will keep you hooked from start to finish, but some of its narrative gaps will leave you with questions. Should that keep you from playing? No – ultimately, this is a very well-executed narrative drama complete with excellent voice acting and a unique art style. Yes, it could have been better in many ways, but it’s still worthy of your time.

&gt;As Dusk Falls is a valiant attempt to tell a good crime drama where actions have consequences. The story went on a lot longer than I expected, as the tense moments at the motel spawned a lot of different threads — both flash forwards and flashbacks — that I didn’t expect. But ultimately the tale failed to move me in the way that I had hoped for.

&gt;As Dusk Falls tackles intimate themes with intimate storytelling. It spends meaningful time with believable characters and complex personal issues. It attempts to explore answers to those relatable and sometimes unanswerable questions about ourselves. And most importantly, it doesn’t get distracted or lost along the way.

&gt;As Dusk Falls offers a great new take on the adventure genre, focusing on a story that feels grounded in the real world, made all the more impactful through its stellar artwork. The multiplayer works fine and is fun, but I found myself wanting to play without others. Satisfying narratively regardless of your choices, As Dusk Falls is weighty and serious, surprising with great writing, realistic characters, and plenty of twists. Highly recommended.

&gt;As Dusk Falls tells a compelling story and offers an excellent gameplay experience. The game tries to fill a significant market gap because the demand for interactive visual novels is relatively high. But teams capable of creating a good story adventure are scarce. Nevertheless, we are delighted that INT./NIGHT studio has tried to do it. The gameplay brings nothing new to the table, but it still manages to tell a competitive story that you'll be thinking about for days after you finish it.

&gt;As Dusk Falls delivered an enthralling narrative with solid characters to follow. The game’s original graphics and art direction were off-putting at first but grew on me over time. The soundtrack and voice acting were both excellent. Multiplayer was well realized and added a whole new dimension to the gameplay. Though the game’s ending was a huge letdown and felt cheap overall. Despite this, As Dusk Falls is a solid experience and is worthy of your time.

&gt;As Dusk Falls is an adult, dramatic adventure with unusual artistic choices, yet functional to an ever engaging narrative. Almost similar to an interactive TV series, it will keep you glued to the screen until the end, eager to discover the fate of the many realistically and often starkly delineated characters, but also to explore the many ramifications of the story. The excellent acting, moreover, succeeds in making the most of such a production. Too bad for a few technical issues lightly impacting the enjoyment of the game, but it is definitely a highly recommended experience for lovers of narrative adventures and TV crime dramas.

&gt;As it ran its course, I realised I quite adored As Dusk Falls. As a decades-spanning crime thriller throughout America's western plains, it's well acted and admirably realised. Although the cliffhanger beckons another chapter, my journey through As Dusk Falls felt whole, though I can't wait to explore all of the possibilities on offer.

&gt;As Dusk Falls is an impressive debut from INTERIOR/NIGHT. It tells an emotionally impactful story with some solid vocal performances. The branching storyline is cleverly implemented and the multiplayer features offer a convenient way to play with friends.

&gt;As Dusk Falls is a tense and exciting drama about crime and the families who get involved in it. If you love crime-drama TV shows, then you'll feel right at home with this game.

&gt;As Dusk Falls is the non-game narrative adventure for your non-gaming family and housemates. It’s the most engaged I’ve ever seen my lapsed casual gamer partner in a videogame and that’s because it has the familiar story pacing of a six-part TV series and almost no gameplay, which means minimal barrier to entry.

&gt;As Dusk Falls caught me by surprise, taking a genre of game that's become a bit too familiar and injecting it with a tense crime drama and a singular flair. My hat goes off to Interior/Night and I'm really looking forward to seeing what they do next.

&gt;For the most part, As Dusk Falls excels as an 'interactive drama.' With wonderfully crafted and relatable characters, superb voice acting, and unique art direction and animation style that lends itself to the story. The first few chapters alone are excellent, and they’ll have you gripping onto your controller when things are tense and utterly deflated when you’re forced into making a tough decision. The game is only let down by a weaker second act and a rushed final chapter, but overall, it’s still a great narrative adventure filled with dramatic moments, tension, and tough choices.

&gt;I’d gone in hoping for a groundbreaking style of narrative-driven experience, one that operated on a sprawling web of branching paths over the course of 30 years of events, and was left underwhelmed by a fairly by-the-numbers entry in the genre that only dips its toe into its three decades-of family history and character entanglement. If you’re a fan of the genre, you’ll probably have some fun with this, but it’s hardly the revelation that the decision-based, narrative-driven genre feels like it so desperately needs.

&gt;This interactive crime drama packs a unique visual style and some gripping moments dealing with mature themes. The choices you make are crucial to the fates of two families, but the impact is more keenly felt in the first act than the second.

I am using the Brainwavz leather earpads with cooling gel, so I get better bass response. Highly recommend these! And of course, this is what my ears like the most. I followed the frequency response curve that RTINGs provided in their review in order to adjust the frequencies for accurate, reference sound! You may like a bit more bass, that's fine. Don't increase the 125hz band too much though! It may muddy the sound in games and music... also, if you find the highs too crispy and painful, you can always tone down the 2khz or 4khz band! Idk how the highs would sound with the stock earpads using this EQ. So you can always leave them at default if you are worried about ear fatigue. As for the 16khz band, I like a bit of airiness, but I'm still unsure where to set that specifically lol.

Microsoft probably receives a crash report (or should) when a game errors out.  They should have a method in place to evaluate the number of crashes and, if it exceeds some percentage based on the active players, freeze purchases of the game or DLC in the Microsoft store until the publisher addresses the issue.

XboxSeriesX,"My launch controller had a fatal stick drift error. By fatal I mean it was registering full tilt in one direction. It was unusable. Ended up selling it on Ebay for scrap and using the proceeds towards a design lab controller. Within a year (and of course past the 6 months warranty) both bumpers stopped working. Disassembled the controller and found that both stems on the bumper snapped clean off. 

This is from normal casual gameplay. The game was extremely bumper heavy (Watchdogs Legion). Yesterday, the left bumper stopped clicking. I'm not hard on controllers and I'm not a super hardcore gamer anymore, but I'm noticing a trend since the Xbox One generation where I went through controllers like candy. For the $60-$70 they ask for these controllers, the build quality is garbage. Especially the Design Lab stuff. I can understand controllers wearing down over the course of 3-4 years, but less than a year is utterly ridiculous. 

I remember PC accessories from ten years ago that still work. Joysticks, flight sticks, racing wheels, etc.  I spent good money on them and they lasted for years. If I could spend a couple hundred on an Xbox controller that was built like a tank and lasted me 10 years, I'd do it. But it seems that even the Elite controllers are garbage build quality.

The margins on these controllers have to be ridiculous because the build quality is cheap. Looking at this broken bumper in my hands, it didn't stand a chance. Looks like a cheap 3D printed part.

Microsoft either needs to improve the build quality of their controllers by using better materials for the sticks, bumpers and buttons or build a modular controller with parts that are easy to swap out when they wear out. But I don't think Microsoft cares. When I suck it up and drop $70 - $100 on a new controller, they just laugh all the way to the bank.

Thankfully, the bumpers are readily available on Amazon and easy to replace. But right now, I'm stuck holding my dick while the replacement comes in.",Xbox One/Series X Controllers Are Terrible Build Quality - Repairing my Second Controller Already This Generation

XboxSeriesX,"Want to be clear here - am really, really not looking for console wars stuff here. At all. I love my PS5 and I greatly enjoyed my 360.

Now that's out of the way! I was lucky enough to get a PS5 at launch via a Sony invitation, and I indeed love it. That said, I was a dual Xbox-PS owner up until the XB1; I was able to buy launch versions of the original's adorable giant black and green box and then the launch 360 with its 20 GB hard drive (lol), followed by the 360 slim. Can't really remember why I never went for the XB1 but I can only surmise that I didn't think it had enough console exclusives or otherwise differentiated itself for me. I don't play FPS so, while I've always enjoyed Halo's single-player campaigns, it's not really a killer app for me.

That said, there's a lot of old games on the 360 that I've wanted to play for a long time (my 360 wore out many years ago after a series of moves). Additionally, it looks like 9th generation consoles might be going back to the sorts of exclusivity agreements that were very common in the 6th and 7th generations.

So, other than Microsoft exclusives (I do kinda wanna try Flight Simulator...) and access to my old 360 library, what might I gain by having both consoles? What differences exist out there other than the physical size of that enormous black mini-fridge, XB Game Pass, and Halo? Are there any other plusses that I might not be aware of? It's my understanding that there's also some nifty integration with Windows PC games but I'm visually impaired and have used Macs for the last 20 years so that doesn't really do anything for me.

Again, to be clear, this is \*not\* in order to replace my PS5, but instead to sit alongside it (probably literally). At this point I'm leaning heavily in favor of trying to get one sometime this year but would definitely love some input. Thanks!",Thoughts on Series X for a happy PS5 owner?

I'm looking for something like GTA online. It has progression as in, you do missions/quests and not only are you upgrading your skills, but also in the other aspects of gameplay. 

I know I'm unable to articulate my idea extremely well, though I hope I'm being understood. 

Please avoid sinple player games.

Looking forward to your recommendations.","Multiplayer Games With Progression, 2017 Onwards"

XboxSeriesX,"I apologise in advance for yet another post about storage, I have tried in vain to find the answers I’m looking for and am an absolute noob when it comes to understanding technology, so here goes…

I’m thinking of getting a Seagate Expansion Card so I can play XSX games from the storage, and an external SSD for the ‘extra’ storage on top, instead of getting the 2TB expansion card - is this the best of both worlds in terms of value for money?

Firstly, SSD’s vs HDD’s - Do they need their own dedicated power supply or do they receive everything needed via the USB?

Are there different types, does it make a difference/is there a noticeable benefit from one over the other? I’m thinking SSD for the obvious benefit in processing speed but does that alone justify the cost? 

Do they have specific hardware requirements such as USB speed etc? Again, any difference? Xbox says it needs to be USB 3.0, anything other that that?

SSD or HDD? Does it really matter if I’m getting a Seagate Expansion Card too?

Does connecting an external SSD/HDD and an expansion card cause any additional load on the Xbox like air con would on a car engine? If so is this healthy, can the Xbox handle it all at once?

Do I need to leave my Xbox is ‘Instant On’ mode or can I continue to use energy saver as I usually do?

How do I go about formatting them for use with a Series X? Can this be done from the console or do I need a PC first?

Thanks for reading of you get this far and for any advice, it’s very much appreciated!

Signed,
A clueless gamer","Another post about storage (sorry, tech noob here)"

# Senate leader Schumer met with Microsoft President Brad Smith to discuss tech antitrust bills

 

 

Senate Majority Leader [Chuck Schumer](https://www.fedscoop.com/tag/chuck-schumer/), D-NY., met with Microsoft President [Brad Smith](https://www.fedscoop.com/tag/brad-smith/) last week while visiting Washington state and discussed bipartisan tech antitrust legislation that Schumer is expected to bring up for a vote later this summer.

&amp;#x200B;

The top Democrat, who is in charge of the Senate’s agenda, discussed policy with Smith including two bills that are making their way through Congress right now related to increasing Big Tech competition, the journalism industry, and data privacy, four sources familiar with the meeting told *FedScoop*.

If they become law, the bills discussed during the meeting could force [Microsoft](https://www.fedscoop.com/tag/microsoft/) and other big tech vendors to change how they operate in consumer and federal markets.

In particular, Senate bills [S.2992](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2992) and [S.2710](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2710) would restrict the collection and use of internal vendor data and place restrictions on Big Tech companies related to installing and uninstalling software on their products.

Schumer was [spotted](https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/schumers-visit-to-seattle/) in Bellevue, Washington last week and is expected to have traveled to the state to meet with tech executives like Smith and for fundraising purposes.

Liberal advocacy groups have recently called on Schumer to [disclose any “dark money”](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2022-07-13-senate-majority-leader-chuck-schumer-disclose-dark-money-donations-from-big-tech) or hidden funds that he and other Democrats have received from Big Tech companies like Microsoft in order to remove the appearance of any conflict of interest.

The [American Innovation and Choice Online Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2992) (S.2992), would prevent tech giants like Amazon from unduly favoring their own products on their websites or creating cheaper copycats of existing products using internal data.

Meanwhile, the [Open App Markets Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2710) (S.2710) would regulate the management of Apple, Google and potentially Microsoft’s app stores, which advocates say would enable greater competition on the platforms.

These are the two most significant antitrust bills that Schumer supports, and which the Senate majority leader is [expected to bring up](https://www.axios.com/2022/05/19/scoop-schumer-seeks-tech-antitrust-bill-vote-by-early-summer) for a vote later this summer. The bills, which have bipartisan backing, are expected to have enough support pass within Congress and become law if they are bought up for a vote.

The legislation could make it more challenging for Microsoft to bundle its software programs like Microsoft Office, Microsoft Teams, One Drive cloud services and others that it sells together or pre-installs to customers in consumer and federal markets. This could give rivals to Microsoft Teams like Zoom and Slack more of a chance to compete for consumers and federal contracts.

Smith has been unclear and noncommittal regarding Microsoft’s stance on the AICOA, [telling Geekwire](https://www.geekwire.com/2022/interview-microsofts-president-on-turbulent-times-for-the-company-country-and-world/) in June that “We’re not trying to lobby in favor of the bill. But that doesn’t mean we’re opposing it either.”

The bill provides a big boost to tech critics and anti-monopolists by creating new rules of the road for Big Tech platforms such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.

“If Microsoft is being wishy washy about the bill, it probably means they’re opposed to it for some reason or the other,” a source familiar with the meeting said.

Microsoft has avoided much of the [antitrust scrutiny](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/microsofts-antitrust/619599/) from Congress, federal agencies, and the public in the past two years while supporting some of the antitrust bills that would hurt Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google which has [angered](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-has-evaded-the-antitrust-scrutiny-of-its-rivals-playing-the-white-knight-11624897722) Microsoft’s fellow tech giants.

Some Republicans, like Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary committee which regulates the tech industry, have even called for Microsoft to face the [same antitrust scrutiny](https://republicans-judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/JDJ-to-Microsoft-6.21.2020.pdf) as other large tech platforms.

Sen. Schumer and Smith also discussed the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at helping the news industry get better compensation for content posted on Big Tech platforms such as Google and Facebook, which Microsoft’s web portal and search engine compete with.

The two leaders also had conversations about online data privacy and regulations around it. Many tech giants have come under fire for their [controversial data-gathering](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hidden-ways-big-tech-sucks-up-data) and usage practices that often secretly infringe on users’ privacy.

Democrats and Republicans favor establishing a national privacy standard to hold Big Tech companies more accountable for how they gather and use the data they collect but there is no consensus on how to do this within a comprehensive piece of legislation.

Microsoft’s pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard and related investments and jobs that could be created within the Capitol Region of New York was also discussed during the meeting, two people said. Schumer also [pushed](https://www.timesunion.com/business/article/Schumer-urges-Microsoft-to-invest-in-Capital-16923948.php) Microsoft to invest more in the video game industry of the region when he met with Smith in February of this year.",Senate leader Schumer met with Microsoft President Brad Smith to discuss tech antitrust bills

the game for the base xbox one (on sale) is £40, while to get it for my series x i HAVE to buy the edition that comes with the deluxe pack and the xbox one version all to just play the series x edition - all for an extra £15 or so.
