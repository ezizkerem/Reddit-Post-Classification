PS5,"So yeah pretty sad situation. Fan stopped working and obviously resulted in overheating issues. I called Sony and they said send her in! I was out of warranty but was willing to pay the fee. 


I sent it, and just a week later I get an email saying that it‚Äôs fixed and on its way back. I even got charged for the fix! Sadly, when I opened up the box, there‚Äôs a little sheet of paper that said ‚Äújust kidding, we didn‚Äôt fix it üòÇ ‚Äú. But actually the reason was literally ‚Äúcorruption in system‚Äù‚Ä¶ 

Spent like 3 days of calls trying to get my money back which I finally did, but now I‚Äôm here with a broke PS5. Any idea of something I could do to maybe get some money out of it or something? Will most likely try and buy another, but would like to sell for parts at least..

Thanks","PS5 broke, sent it in to Sony for repair, they didn‚Äôt fix it claiming ‚Äúcorruption to system‚Äù‚Ä¶ what can I do next?"

PS5,"I saw that there's a PS4 and also a native PS5 version for the upcoming TMNT Cowabunga Collection.

But, what's the difference? (Except for the PS5 version not being playable on PS4). From what I can tell it's the exact same thing, same number of games, same features, and since it's older 8- and 16-bit titles being emulated I doubt there's any difference in performance either.

So what's the benefit of the PS5 version over the PS4 version?

And also, if I buy the PS4 version, is there an update for the PS5 version included, does anyone know?","TMNT Cowabunga Collection PS4 vs PS5, what's the difference?"

The picture on the item is the one that I see most of the time on YouTube tutorials but for some reason mine is just very thin. I've never done anything like this at the computer or a console so any help would be great,do I have the right ssd?

If I rotate the right stick in a clockwise motion, it feels smooth. If I rotate the left stick in a clockwise motion, it feels sorta rough, like something is holding it back. I can also hear something kinda rubbing inside I think. The controller was fine last night, and it still works, but it's really annoying. I would open it up to see if something is in there, but i don't see anywhere to open it. I also rotated it for a good five minutes to see if whatever it was would loosen up or something, but the stick still feels rough. I have no clue what caused this, or how to fix it.

PS5,"I was playing Stray in a relatively hot room with not a lot of ventilation (approx 32¬∞C or 90¬∞F). I left my PS5 on then accidentally fell asleep. 

The next day, I tried to power on and it wouldn't start. It wouldn't even start in safe mode. I took it to a repair shop, and the guy told me that the motherboard's fried and it's effectively dead. I wanted more details but as I was communicating in my non-native language, I was struggling to get more information. 

1. Is the repair guy accurate? Is my 1y 3m years old console dead? 
2. What are my options if he isn't accurate and there is chance of a repair? 
3. What would a motherboard repair look like?

PS5,"This seems like a big performance boost for Xbox Series X &amp; the Series S. I might be wrong about this. But this could mean that meme of a portable speaker/stove the Series S could be performing or out performing the PS5 with a similar or superior upscaled image with better anti aliasing. The Series X is already more powerful than the PS5. I can't even imagine the performance boost it's going to get. Maybe 60 fps 4k Upscaled Ray tracing ? It's definitely going to be hitting 120 fps easily. 

I remember seeing something about Xbox mentioning they would be using AMDs Graphics card full power or compatibility or something. Guessing they were probably hinting about FSR &amp; they knew Playstation weren't getting it somehow ? 

PlayStation might come out with a PS5 Pro with a compatible Graphics card if for some reason they can't enable it on the current PS5's hardware. Not sure if they just didn't pay the extra pennies to have full compatibility for their custom AMD graphics card or something. I know Xbox...well bank of mum &amp; dad Microsoft most likely paid for the full package &amp; probably extras.

Either way I'm happy for Xbox. I hope they do ridiculously well. Since fanboys and girls can't read between the lines. This is a good thing for us PlayStation gamers! This means PlayStation/Sony have to respond which is a win win for gamers. I stand by this. I think PlayStation/Sony have been slacking. Xbox right now can't really compete with the number of high quality exclusives PlayStation keep releasing. That's why they're buying up all these studios. They're also competing in other ways like Gamepass &amp; backwards compatibility (being able to pop in an og Xbox + Xbox 360 gen game &amp; have it work is impressive - I'm jelly ) &amp; those 60 fps frame boosts on games including old gen games like GTA 4 is also impressive. 

I know some people still haven't been able to get a PS5 and I've been lucky enough to have one since March 2021. But apart from the 60fps boosts in a few games. It's kinda been a little underwhelming for me. I'm still pissed they got rid of two of their best apps, Communities &amp; Live from PlayStation!!!! üò≠ Once they got rid of those two things it was very clear to me PlayStation were definitely becoming more anticonsumer. 

Tried not to rant but it pisses me off how fanboys and fangirls give these companies a pass and blind loyalty. Then wonder why nothing significant is improving but getting worse. NPC behaviour.",Is FSR 2.0 coming to PS5 ? Or is it just for Xbox ?

Elden Ring looks more satisfying for the customization and gameplay challenge and depth; but I don't like how it ends and doesn't give you a reason to play long-term. 

While Valhalla looks more satisfying for the story, side activities, and settlement progression and longer gameplay. Although, I'm not sure if the character customization and combat are satisfying?

In a medium where a lot of games tell us they are bringing story telling to a new level, this one actually accomplishes that. I fear it might go under the radar because its so different to most games. I was unsure myself but took a chance and I am glad I did.

PS5,"Before I get too much hate here, note that my issues with Returnal don't stem from the fact that it's a roguelite. Roguelites (not to be confused with rogueLIKEs) are one of my favorite genres, having binged the hell out of Slay the Spire, Hades, Dead Cells, Dicey Dungeons and others. But having become a big fan of the genre, in large part because excellent game design is crucial for a good roguelite, I become pretty critical of games that fumble it. And I was extremely excited for the first AAA roguelite to hit. But this is... not it.

I feel there are a set of features that typically make for an excellent roguelite. Not all the greats have ALL of these down, but I feel they're generally hard to argue against:

1. A feeling of progression between runs.
2. Good variety of randomly generated level layouts.
3. Loot that adds lots of variety to the core gameplay and different ways to play, as well as interesting risk/reward mechanics.
4. Incentive to explore and experiment with different builds.
5. Ability to create powerful synergies between abilities in a run.

Not an exhaustive list by any means, but these are the sort of things I look for in a good roguelite. I would argue that my favorite roguelites I mentioned above do all five of these things well.

And I would argue that Returnal does almost every single one of them in either a mediocre or poor fashion. I've played about 15 hours and have struggled hard against the second biome's boss several times, and at this point I think I'm done.

First of all, if you're not great at shooters, it's very possible that Returnal will feel like bashing your head against a brick wall. The weapon proficiency mechanics, ether and item unlocks feel woefully insufficient to make me feel like I'm making any progress at all between runs unless I manage to progess to a new biome. 

Last night I had a friend who loves roguelites and enjoys shooters give it a shot, and he was shocked at just how hostile the game is to the player. While roguelites are meant to be hard, it feels to me that Returnal gives you very little to work with unless you want to invest a LOT of time trying the same things over and over, or exploring every nook and cranny of an area. Runs through the first biome frequently only grant limited variations of the starter pistol and maybe one other weapon, artifacts and stat augments are extremely rare, and lots of exploration feels discouraged if you don't have a great build because some rooms will have exteme difficulty spikes that'll have you dead in no time. Additionally, the risk/reward mechanics feel unbalanced as all hell - with very significant weight on the ""risk"" piece and not so much reward. Opening a highly malignant chest to get a one time use item that converts enemy projectiles into obelites? A parasite that gives you 30% off one shop item but two malfunctions when it detaches? That's not risk/reward, it's just... risk.

So exploring helps, but comes with a substantial struggle - while the first stage in many roguelites will feel easy for those who have gotten used to the game, exploring the first biome in Returnal remains pretty tough and risky even after 15 hours. But then if I skip right to the second biome as soon as I can in the beginning of the run, I don't have much of anything to turn the tide in that final boss fight. Don't get me wrong though - I've had plenty of tries exploring the first biome FULLY and still not having much of anything to help me in the second, but at least there's a chance. But having to spend 45 minutes exploring a level on EACH run just for a CHANCE of finding a couple good items does not make for good design, at all.

It's frustrating to me because Returnal's core gameplay is great, the story is interesting and the presentation, especially the audio and Dualsense, are absolutely top notch. But it's just not fun to keep playing the same areas and level layouts over and over and over again, having to fully explore this environment I've played dozens upon dozens of times in order to have any hope of progressing. This might be a case of ""get gud"", sure, but given my experience with roguelites I don't think the problem here is just me.","Returnal is a good shooter and a great showcase for the PS5 and Dualsense, but a pretty bad roguelite."

I'm willing to spend more for the disc version because I have it in my head I will save that money in the long term by buying used games.

I don't want to pay too much, but most of the disc editions the people are still asking way too much. I can find digital versions, some with an extra controller (which I could just sell), for retail price or a bit less than retail price. I'm not happy paying retail price for a used console but you still can't just walk into a store and buy a PS5, so it is what it is I guess.

I'm not willing to pay $90+ CAD for new games especially when I don't get a physical disc. Does the PS Store have decent sales like the PC market does? At this point, I pretty much only want a PS5 to play Demon's Souls, Returnal, TLOU1/2, Elden Ring, Horizon, maybe Miles Morales. Beyond that I don't really care. Since for the most part these are old games except Elden Ring I can likely find them used for a low price. I don't play multiplayer games, so I wouldn't be needing to get Playstation Plus, either. Although, I saw several of these games are included in the ""Extra"" subscription and $115/yr CAD doesn't seem too bad for that library of games.

Gameplay is top down ARPG twin stick shooter. Really fun with amazing powers and weapons. I really hope developers got enough support to have a sequel.

PS5,"I just replayed TLOU2 recently, and after still loving it I dove back into old posts about it. I read a ton of hate on the story but noticed even the haters admitting the opposite for the gameplay.

The gameplay is really where it shines, from exploration in a non open world, I think the level design is top class. Looting is quick, controls are snappy, crafting is quick and not cumbersome, you have all heard the praise for this game dozens of times I am sure...

This brings me to my replay of RDR2. After finishing TLOU2, I needed another thing to play. I really want to save Stray for my wife and I together, and having PS+ Extra I decided, fuck it, I will play RD again.

Man. This game is a slog and a half to get through. I remember really being enamored by the world, the graphics, the systems, everything my first playthrough. I even remember the criticisms of it being slow, but I took it as a deliberate choice R* made to keep the game grounded. But after playing these two gaming behemoths back to back, I have to say these criticisms really ring true the second time. Holding x to ride a horse next to a person for 10 minutes, to shoot a wolf, just to ride a horse for 10 minutes again is not fun. Holding square to loot EVERY ITEM is cumbersome. Holding triangle sometimes to interact, but then holding square to interact is a confusing choice. I just cannot believe how much of a 180 I am experiencing on this game my second time through. To be honest, I might just stop with it and move on to something different.

TLDR: RDR2 was one of my favorite games in 2018, and in 2022 I can't make it past the first chapter.

# Sony Gaming Unit Adds Uber Antitrust Lawyer Amid Expansion Plans

 

Sony Interactive Entertainment Corp. has hired a new top antitrust and public policy lawyer in Gregory McCurdy, who held a similar position at Uber Technologies Inc.

McCurdy, Sony‚Äôs new senior director for competition and regulatory affairs, arrives as the company‚Äôs gaming subsidiary recently made a key acquisition and scuttled an antitrust class action. He left Uber last month, shortly before the ridesharing giant‚Äôs former top European lobbyist [leaked a trove](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/uber-lobbied-politicians-broke-laws-in-global-push-reports-1) of company documents.

A Sony spokesperson confirmed McCurdy‚Äôs hire, which he announced in a recent [message posted](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6944667545744396289/) to his LinkedIn profile.

‚ÄúThe world of video games is fascinating and will be a great new adventure for me,‚Äù McCurdy said via LinkedIn. He [spent](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/document/X8I38LVK000000) more than 15 years as a senior litigation and policy lawyer for Microsoft Corp. prior to joining Uber in 2015. ‚ÄúI know it a bit from my Microsoft days when Xbox launched to compete with PlayStation,‚Äù McCurdy said.

His senior director role at Sony is a [new one](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6899419008320311297/), per an [online posting](https://jobsearcher.com/j/senior-director-competition-regulatory-affairs-at-playstation-global-in-washington-dc-rvW8V97) for the job. The posting said the person filling the role would would become a ‚Äúsenior level member‚Äù of the PlayStation video game console maker‚Äôs global legal leadership and ‚Äúprimary competition and regulatory counsel‚Äù for the company‚Äôs business worldwide.

McCurdy didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment. Nor did Stephanie Burns, who [joined Sony last year](https://www.sie.com/en/blog/sie-leadership-spotlight-stephanie-burns/) as legal chief for its San Mateo, Calif.-based gaming unit.

That business includes PlayStation and the video game company Bungie Inc., whose [$3.6 billion sale to Sony](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/mergers-and-acquisitions/sony-buys-destiny-game-developer-bungie-for-3-6-billion) closed earlier this month. Sony reportedly has plans to [turn](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-02-04/sony-s-plan-with-video-game-studio-bungie-is-a-subscription-service) Bungie into a [subscription service](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/playstation-plans-new-service-to-take-on-xbox-game-pass) for video games.

Sony and its lawyers from Shearman &amp; Sterling also scored a win this week by convincing a federal judge in California to [dismiss a putative class action](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/antitrust/sony-gets-court-to-toss-video-gamers-playstation-antitrust-suit) accusing its PlayStation store of [anti-competitive practices](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/sony-sued-for-limiting-purchases-of-games-to-playstation-store). McCurdy, a former co-chair of the American Bar Association‚Äôs antitrust committee, is well-versed on such issues.

At Uber, he led a team handling US antitrust litigation and merger clearance proceedings. McCurdy was also previously Microsoft‚Äôs [first antitrust litigator](https://www.concurrences.com/en/auteur/greg-mccurdy) in Europe, where he spent eight years managing antitrust proceedings before the European Commission in Brussels and appeals to courts in Luxembourg.

## Uber‚Äôs Influence

McCurdy initially co-led an Uber group that provided advice on legislative, legal, and transportation policy matters to the ridesharing giant‚Äôs government relations and communications teams during a critical time in the company‚Äôs growth cycle, according to online biographical materials.

That work included counseling Uber in its ‚Äúdealings with state and municipal governments and airport authorities who are all active in regulating taxi and for-hire vehicle services,‚Äù said a description of McCurdy‚Äôs duties on his LinkedIn profile. ‚ÄúThese issues are key to Uber‚Äôs rapid growth and innovation in hundreds of jurisdictions in the US and around the world.‚Äù

Uber‚Äôs efforts to [influence government authorities](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/uber-lyft-influencers-find-democratic-allies-toughest-to-sway) as it expanded globally between 2013 and 2017 were the subject of the ‚Äú[Uber Files](https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/),‚Äù a collection of 124,000 corporate records turned over to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists by former company lobbyist [Mark MacGann](https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/uber-lobbyist-whistleblower-mark-macgann/).

The leaked files [outline the tactics](https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/uber-global-rise-lobbying-violence-technology/) that Uber used to expand into new markets by recruiting politicians and implementing [aggressive measures](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/ubers-greyball-draws-ire-for-blocking-government-stings) to thwart regulators and law enforcement bodies. Uber acknowledged past mistakes in a [statement](https://www.uber.com/newsroom/icij-statement/).

A spokeswoman for Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick, who [resigned in 2017](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/uber-ceo-kalanick-relinquishes-power-after-investor-mutiny) as Uber‚Äôs top executive and is [now hiring lawyers](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/travis-kalanicks-real-estate-startup-looking-for-legal-talent) for his real estate startup, issued a separate [statement](https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/statement-travis-kalanick/) denying that he acted inappropriately or directed illegal actions.

‚ÄúThe reality was that Uber‚Äôs expansion initiatives were led by over a hundred leaders in dozens of countries around the world and at all times under the direct oversight and with the full approval of Uber‚Äôs robust legal, policy, and compliance groups,‚Äù said Kalanick‚Äôs spokeswoman, Devon Spurgeon.

Salle Yoo, Uber‚Äôs top lawyer until she [left the company](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/ubers-legal-chief-is-said-to-depart-as-ceo-sets-new-course) in 2017 following Kalanick‚Äôs ouster, said in a statement that ‚Äúwe developed systems to ensure the company acted ethically and consistent with the law in the countries where we operated.‚Äù

Yoo sold off [millions in Uber stock](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/document/X20GV9BK000000) after leaving the company. She resurfaced last year at IonQ Inc., a quantum computing outfit she [joined as legal chief](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/ubers-ex-legal-chief-joins-quantum-computing-company-ionq) as it prepared to go public. An IonQ spokeswoman confirmed that Yoo has since left the company, which hired a [new top lawyer](https://ionq.com/posts/march-28-2022-ionq-welcomes-laurie-babinski-anant-sanchetee) in March.",Sony Gaming Unit Adds Uber Antitrust Lawyer Amid Expansion Plans

PS5,"Hello all, just looking for some guidance in case anyone here has had a similar situation. Someone forced their way inside my house while I was gone for about 20 minutes and took my PS5 right from my room, among other things. I searched and saw plenty of people who had theirs stolen during delivery but I‚Äôm assuming in that case you would just get refunded or a new console. 

I had mine for over a year and a half. There were multiple accounts logged in and of course card information attached. I already called PS Support, and the lady I spoke to didn‚Äôt really seem like she knew anything. Ultimately she walked me through deactivating the console online and I did but I‚Äôm not sure if that did anything past just logging me out. Can anyone confirm what happens when you deactivate remotely? 

I‚Äôve also seen where a few people have said Sony could brick it if I provided the console information but again, the lady I spoke with was unhelpful in that regard. And when I reached out to their support page on twitter they just redirected me to some isp request website. 

I figure this is a long shot but can I get it tracked? I‚Äôm pretty sure it was someone in my neighborhood who was watching the house.

PS5,"I'd like to lead with I personally find the $70 price tag a bit high, but here is an example of consumer/corporation mindset as to why it is priced this way.

I buy a new car for $60000. It is top of the line, with all the new features, safety, tech etc. I love this car, it gets me where I need to go and continues to work well even 10 years after I bought it.

A new model is released (usually this would be yearly, but for the sake of this discussion lets keep it at a decade) and is now priced at 70000 due to inflation, with many of the new features and improvements that were seen in the automotive industry over the past 10 years. I love the look and feel of this new car, but can't justify the upgrade because my old one is working well. I might be able to sell/trade in the old car for a fraction of what I bought it for, but the difference is still not worth it. I decide to not buy the new car.

Do I get angry at the manufacturers? Do I demand a cheaper upgrade because I am an existing customer? Do I tweet the company making the car saying that they are cheating customers out of money because thet could just buy a car like mine for cheaper? Do I get upset because this new car doesn't have all the features I personally want? Do I yell at those who want to buy the new car either because they don't have the car, or are looking to  try the upgrade themselves?

The answer should be no, because while this car is still a great product - it isn't for me. It is for those who want the new car. Who are looking to drive this car for the first time, or to buy a brand new model to take for a spin.

It's ok to not want the new thing, or for a new thing to not be made specifically for you. It's ok to think something is too expensive for you right now and to wait for a sale. It's ok.",The Last of Us Part 1 - and buying a new car

The supporting cast is the best in any AC game even beating Ezio games. The ship combat is still awesome and the game graphics are still eye pleasing. I stopped BF in favor of playing Ezio games first as I plan to replay the Ezio/Altair saga first and then the Kenway Saga.  Now only if Ubi patch these games to 60fps on ps5.

PS5,Is there a list of what games premium has over extra. I can upgrade to Extra for ¬£13.60 or Premium for ¬£20 so not much difference either way,I cant find an easy list of what games Premium gives you over Extra?
PS5,"So I just got a PS5. Redeemed close to 600 dollars on PSN credit through multiple rewards sources and bought a lot of games over the last 10 days with an extra 200 dollars of my own money. I bought games on sale, that are now on sale cheaper or with extra DLC in new bundles on in the summer sale, all within the last 10 days. Sony has a 14 day and no download policy for refunds. None of my games were downloaded. I reached out to their support with 11 games I wanted to refund, so I can repurchase them at their new cheaper rate. Would save me about 45 dollars in the long run. 

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted their customer support and they refunded one game. I told them I had 10 more, and the support stuff ended the chat. I contacted them again, they told me they would honor 6 but moving forward I can't refund anymore in general? WTF? I spent 800 dollars on games, and you want to limit me after I try to save 45 dollars? 

&amp;#x200B;

So there is that, then there is their atrocious store itself that I guess has individual listings for separate versions of games as their own version, even though it's the same game and it's hard to figure out what you want unless you design your own spreadsheet.  For example, I own both Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy. But the bundle on the store for both games is available to purchase. Other examples are I own Devil May Cry 4, but can't buy the complete collection with includes DMC and 1-3, which would save me money. I can't purchase that bundle because I own DMC 4, which is annoying. I purchased Arkham Knight Premium Edition for 8 dollars 10 days ago, and now the complete Arkham Collection is on sale for 8.99, and I can't purchase it and Sony won't return the game. Where Steam shows everything you own and normally gives you discount on bundles for already owing stuff in it.",I have to vent about how terrible the PSN Store and Sony Support is

Luckily didn't damage anything around it. I called sony, and was within warranty, they are sending me a refurbished ps5 that they have repaired in exchange for my broken one.

I called again today to ask if they could provide me with the details of what went wrong with my previous console, having not received the refurbished one yet, but they refused. Apparently, they don't typically explain issues but considering that the issue could have caused damage to my other belongings, I feel like I deserve to know what went wrong.

Everyone I've spoken to has said that it is in my 'consumer rights' to know exactly what went wrong with the console.

At the end of the day, I'm just a teenager who has worked their holidays away, I've already worked hard enough for my PS5, but I want to know what went wrong with my first one, given I treated it perfectly.

PS5,"PlayStation 5 has just offered a great gaming experience over the past year for me. A great, consistent 60fps for games that support the higher fps, and dynamic resolutions I honestly can‚Äôt tell apart other than just looking so good on a 4K screen. 

But, with the console being backwards compatible with every PS4 game and PS5 games that offer fidelity mode, the 30fps the PlayStation provides looks very choppy. Almost unplayable. I‚Äôm sure these kinds of concerns have shown up before. But, I just need to hear some thoughts.

I‚Äôm sure one commons idea is that getting a taste of 60fps kind of destroys 30fps forever. However, I have a personal experience that contradicts that. I played a game on both PS4 and PS5 just to compare, with the game running on PS5 having the locked frame rate at 30. It was The Evil Within 2. The experience I came out with was that the PS4 running the game at 30fps looked significantly smoother than the PS5 running the game at 30fps. The PS5 ran 30fps very choppy. I tried adjusting motion blur options to see if that‚Äôs what the difference was, but the PS5 version felt worse minus the better resolution. And it doesn‚Äôt just stop at The Evil Within 2.

Games locked at 30fps seem to look and feel better on a PS4 than they do on a PS5, and I don‚Äôt know why. Is it just my PS5? 

Does it have something to do with how the PS5 handles software? I‚Äôve heard of something called frame pacing. I don‚Äôt know what that is, but apparently it‚Äôs makes a big difference regardless if the frame rates being compared are the same.

I just wanted to check in with the community.",Why does 30fps look choppy on PS5?

PS5,"Having played the game, its quiet evident that most that development time likely went into developing the environments, storyboarding and things of that nature. Which was time well-spent because in my opinion, the environmental design is immaculate, while also being more varied and detailed than I expected. 

A lot of love and effort went into creating the game. Its beautiful, has a novel concept and doesn't wear out its welcome. Game length is a topic worth discussing and in the case of Stray, I don't think it would have benefited from an extended runtime, unless the developers were constantly introducing new mechanics, which from the nature of the game and the amount of time it took to develop what is there, is not at all realistic.

I didn't pay for the game since I am subscribed to PS Plus Extra, but I do think it is worth the $30 asking price. Of course, whether or not the game is worth it you is a personal decision.",Stray has been in development since at least 2016 and is a 4-6hr game

PS5,,What are some things about the PS5 you don't like or feel was done better on PS4?
PS5,"A couple of nights ago, I ejected Horizon Forbidden West to pop in Elden Ring and have it download the PS5 version. When I tried to insert the disc, it didn't go in. Instead, I could hear and feel the rollers grinding as they spun and struggled to pull in the disc.

Other reddit posts were dated within a year of the PS5 release, so I didn't have the luxury of a warranty. I kept reading and saw some people indicated I should try sitting it horizontally, disconnecting the hard drive, unplugging power, forcing a disc in(?!) etc. 

I tried every combination of all of these. Eventually, it took the disc while powered off and laying horizontally and I honestly had no clue why**.

Days passed and I feared ejecting that disc, so I didn't. Come Monday (yesterday), I called PlayStation support. I had to peel off my *sick* custom skin from the bottom to get at the model number (smh) and provided all the info they needed.

But, as I already knew, I was out of my one year warranty. The price? $229 plus tax. Yikes. Hell no.

Next plan. Wife and kids asleep early so, I stayed up and tinkered. I watched tons of disassembly videos of the disc drive. They showed how the gears might be damaged, how the loading mechanism can slip out of place, how one specific gear might be the cause and so on. 

But I didn't want to risk disassembling it, not yet. You see, those $229 are conditional. They will only accept the repair if you haven't done anything that *would have* voided your (expired) warranty. 

So before committing to full disassembly, I decided to check what I could see from within the drive slot. Fortunately, I happened to have the internet's most advertised electronics toolkit, which came in handy.

The drive slot does have a rather intrusive bit of felt covering the drive slot to protect it from dust, so that had to be pulled towards me and taped down and out of the way.

I could see the plastic loading mechanism sort of jammed up, so I poked it and it popped back to its normal spot.

But the one thing I couldn't wrap my head around was this copper piece towards the front right (i.e. the bottom when standing, I was laying it upside down with the disc drive facing up). I skimmed through the teardown videos and there was no copper piece to be found.

So I looked closer at it...


It's at this point I'd like to share that my wife and kids and I went to an aquarium last month. In fact, just earlier yesterday, we were watching footage of my 3-year-old's mesmerized reaction to seeing real sharks‚Äîhis favorite animal‚Äîfor the first time swimming above and around him in a glass tunnel.

Well, as one often finds at aquariums and zoos and theme parks, this aquarium had‚Äîand I'm sure you might've guessed this by now‚Äîa penny smasher.

So there I was staring at a shark-imprinted piece of ruined currency sitting at a rather obtrusive angle, keeping discs from being able to slip into the console.

I had to lay on my back, prop the PS5 above me on the sofa, and use some thin, curved tweezers to pull that coin out.

Popped that plastic disc loader piece back to default position, pulled off the tape, booted the PS5, waited for it to fully start up and adjust its disc drive motor, and then popped a disc into the slot.

Slid in like there was never a problem. Smooth. Quiet. Beautiful.

Also I installed the SSD and red light bar filters.

** Also I can't prove this but I suspect the people who fixed the issue by laying their console horizontally also just had a small coin or other object in there that would lay flat and out of the way.

TL;DR: My PS5 wouldn't accept discs, turns out my kid stuck a coin in there. Removing it fixed the problem.",My PS5 Was Not Accepting Discs and I Fixed It Last Night. Here is My Story.

My opinion overall, good game, lots of attention put into little cat details that those who have lived with a cat know all too well. However, it was so short‚Ä¶.and I felt the emotion all the way through, but then felt so let down at the end‚Ä¶like why didn‚Äôt we get to see us meet back up with our cat fam from the beginning?

PS5,,can someone help me with my problem
PS5,"So i've been long time PC user, especially on Steam platform. I just bought PS5, because now I've 3 sons. I've very few questions, please answer them :)

1. When you create account on Steam, depending on your region, prices are different. Some regions are like 2 or 3 times cheaper than US price. Is there same feature available on Playstation store?
2. I always pay attention on /r/GameDeals for new deals on Steam, is there any sub for same purpose? If I pay attention on this sub, is it same?
3. When I want to see price history on any steam game, I always search on [https://steamdb.info/](https://steamdb.info/). It have amazing history database for every game on Steam. Is there same site for Playstation games? For example currently I'm thinking about buy Tekken7 &amp; Minecraft. But I'm not sure when to buy. Like if there are huge sale coming (Like steams Autumn sale), I can wait little. Also I want to see their historical low price etc. Where to see?
4. Currently I'm using my main and only TV in home, and thinking about buy budget/cheap one. I'm aiming 4k resolution, 60hz, and either 43"" or 50"" TV. My coach is really near to wall/tv. There is only 1.5m distance. Which one better? And any more requirement on TV?
5. I ordered high rise Kontrol Freek, because I'm sure my aiming on Dual Sense will be suck. Any other tip/trick/gadget/accessory you might suggest?",New PS5 user have some questions

PS5,"I don‚Äôt know if region locks are applying or something. 

I have a British PS5 that I have brought to America for the summer. I recently went to GameStop and picked up a used copy of DS3 for seven bucks. I inserted it and lo and behold, it was working properly. I played for about four hours. 

This morning I purchased the Season Pass on the PS App. Then I clicked on the pages of Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City separately, and clicked ‚Äúdownload to console.‚Äù Figured I‚Äôd eat breakfast then go and play. 

When I opened my PS5, it showed that the DLC had been downloaded and installed. I closed the running instance of DS3, then opened the game again, and it didn‚Äôt recognise that the DLC had been installed. 

I restarted my PS5 to no effect. I reinstalled DS3 to again no effect. 

When I go to the store page for the DLC and the Season Pass, it says ‚Äúinstalled‚Äù and ‚Äúpurchased‚Äù respectively. 

What can I do? I don‚Äôt wanna be out 20 bucks for nothing.",Dark Souls 3 not recognising season pass purchase?
PS5,"So I got an email saying that I reserved a chance getting a PS5, and I never really had the idea in me of getting one but now that I have a chance of buying at retail price has spiked my interest. As a PC player I hate that I don‚Äôt get access to PS5 exclusives but recently Sony has been releasing exclusives to steam which I‚Äôm really glad, but at the same time I hate waiting years after PS5 release.

Loved being just thrown into the high stakes situation with no knowledge and using the android's detective skills to try and piece together what happened. Was getting heavy Batman Arkham vibes from the system and it was interesting as from the get go you are obviously treated in a negative connotation because you aren't human.

Then after I pieced the scene together to have an idea of what happened in my head, that whole scene on the patio outset had me riveted on the edge of my seat. I was frantically thinking of the next thing to do or not thinking because of the pressure and it felt like it all played out fairly organically. 

All in all I can't wait to sink some more hours in and see where the story goes for each character but I had to come post about the first 15 minutes or so because I thought it was extremely well done in terms of showcasing the kind of game you are about to be playing.",Detroit: Become Human appreciation post (First time playing)

&gt;Lost, alone and separated from family, a stray cat must untangle an ancient mystery to escape a long-forgotten city.    
&gt;  
&gt;Stray  is a third-person cat adventure game set amidst the detailed, neon-lit  alleys of a decaying cybercity and the murky environments of its seedy  underbelly. Roam surroundings high and low, defend against unforeseen  threats and solve the mysteries of this unwelcoming place inhabited by  curious droids and dangerous creatures.   
&gt;  
&gt;See the world through  the eyes of a cat and interact with the environment in playful ways. Be  stealthy, nimble, silly, and sometimes as annoying as possible with the  strange inhabitants of this mysterious world.   
&gt;  
&gt;Along the way, the  cat befriends a small flying drone, known only as B-12. With the help  of this newfound companion, the duo must find a way out.   
&gt;

PS5,"Long story short, I've know this guy for a couple of years and i considered him my friend, his family was quite poor so he didn't have a lot of games and he was very excited to play Elden Ring

So since I had it digitally a week ago I gave him my account so he could play it for free after a couple of days he tried to steal my account so i deleted him, changed the pw and deactivated all the consoles from my account, but today I discovered from other friends that he still have my games on his account unlocked

Everywhere I look online says it's dual voltage, but also nowhere do you actually get a clear answer because on every reddit post people eventually start talking about their ps3s being dual voltage. And nowhere does anyone say without a doubt that their PS5 that says 220-240v actually works on 110v.
So my question is, can anybody that has actually experienced this issue please shed some light on this, so that I know whether I should return it or not?",Is my PS5 from middle east dual voltage?

My local gamestop told me to purchase a ps5 from them I needed to buy crap like a 2nd controller, charging station, headset, ect. $500 console and $410 in accessories to walkout with it.

Their exact quote was until the ""market works itself out"" they are doing their required bundle system.

PS5,"Okay, so I've had my PS5 for no more than 2 weeks and I noticed almost right away that it makes this little sound/noise when either turned off or in rest mode.

I don't even know if static/electric is the best way to describe it and it doesn't happen all the time, just mostly, I think.

I should add that it's really faint, you have to be up close to it, so it doesn't Bother me in that sense, I'm more worried that something might be wrong.

It only stops when I unplug the power cable.

The reason why I'm worried is because I Have heard that sound before, in our old TV(although it still made that sound when turned on, and loud enough that you could actually hear it over a quiet scene)

I don't even know if it would be loud enough for me to record it, I'll give it a try later and post it on my youtube.
Has anyone experienced anything similar, is it common, rare, should I be worried?","""Electric/Static"" Sound"

When it arrived, it booted up, I installed Horizon Forbidden West, a few other games and played all night. I put the console to sleep and went to bed. When I woke up I tried to boot the console up to see if everything installed correctly, the ps5 wouldn't boot. It would beep once, then power down. It couldnt enter safe mode and the one time I got it to boot it tried to repair system files and then failed again. After trying different cables and outlets, and power cycling and repeating the above steps (aswell as the disk insert and controller wake up fixes to the rest mode bug) I called in a repair with sony. 

Did I just get unlucky and get a faulty ps5 or did I brick the system by using a non standard cable? Ive ordered this [cable instead](Naths Hardware Euro Power Cable... https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07CN3X3BX?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) and a UK to eu power adapter for when I get a replacement but I just want to be certain.",Will a UK ps5 work in Germany?

PS5,,Should I choose my ps5 or girlfriend she gave me a ultimatum
PS5,"My fiance and I just got our second PS5. 

The first one is a digital edition with a 2TB NVME in it, and the new one is a disk version. First one is in the living room. We'd like to switch them so the digital one is in the bedroom and the disk version is in the living room. Hence my question:

What's the best way to swap an NVME between PS5's? Is it as simple as just taking it out of one and installing it in another? Best case scenario I was thinking would be to set up the new one, get signed into it, AND THEN install the drive with all our games on it. Worst case scenario is obviously just deleting the 1.8 TB of games that are on it and installing it fresh in the new console.

For almost a year I was sad that all the movies and shows seemed and sounded a little weird. They look good, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but they don‚Äôt look great. Told my girlfriend I would try getting a 4K Apple TV to see if it would actually display as Dolby Vision with Dolby Atmos, but she recommended that I simply try watching directly from my LG Nanocell90.

I contacted Sony and had to pay ¬£250 out of pocket to get the PS5 repaired as it was just out of warranty. They sent me a refurbished PS5 that had a fault (the expandable SSD slot was broken). 

I returned this second PS5 and received another refurbished console. This one broke within MINUTES as I was setting the console up. It froze, lost power and is stuck in a loop where it repairs the hard drive then loses power.

I contacted sony and asked for a brand new console instead of a refurb or a refund of the entire price of the console. This was denied and they insisted I would get a refurbished console and ""these are fully tested to ensure they are up to our quality standards before being sent out to you."" Which is clearly not true.

What are my options here? I bought a product that is faulty and have given them 2 opportunities to correct the faulty product. Each repair takes 15+ working days so I've been without a working console for quite some time.

PS5,"Hello everyone,  
¬†  
I would like to share my¬†**ULTIMATE¬†set of¬†Optimized Settings for all LG 2017-2022 OLEDs and Xbox One/Series X|S , PC, PS4/PS5¬†and Switch gaming**, with the best PQ and lowest Input-Lag results possible (from 4ms to 21ms based on model) and¬†**also including Dolby Vision and webOS in-built Apps settings for Movies and TV Shows**.

¬†

These settings are the results of 5+ years of gathering professional calibration results (using external equipment and software), valuable online knowledge from the most reliable sources and direct testing &amp; analysis.  
¬†  
Yeah, I know, ""settings¬†_cannot be copy/pasted from TV to TV as they're all different_"" , but tested LG OLED variance between models is much lower then average, and even within a 3% variance you will still experience a much more accurate image compared to default presets, plus CMS and WB advanced options weren't touched in order to avoid variance error as much as possible.  
¬†  
There are¬†**6 Profiles¬†to independently 1-time-Setup for each source/content combination**, and then forget about it.  
¬†  
In order to do it, just change the video source to the one you want to calibrate (for example: webOS Netflix app, or to HDMI1 connected to Xbox Series X / PS5) and then load up the type of video content you want to calibrate (for example: launch an SDR Game, or an HDR Game, or a Dolby Vision movie).  
¬†  
Once you're ready,¬†**apply the Optimized Settings specifically for your LG OLED Series**¬†(see the sections below to identify your TV settings):  
¬†  
¬†  
**Recommended Settings for LG 2017 OLED Series only:**

- [**Xbox One/Series X|S, PC &amp; PS4/PS5 + SDR Suggested Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KHY0Y-5dzfkMj8Xl2XrnOgqSX6FFp04IDd5gv_F699Y/edit?usp=sharing) -¬†_Note_: try to launch any SDR content to start calibrating, for example just stay in the Dashboard Home. All Xbox SDR contents will share the calibration;  
¬†
- [**Xbox One/Series X|S, PC &amp; PS4/PS5 + HDR Suggested Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j1ArpZ_OOJP2K3oeogB7eou7NRPJlKLxpEc6kI5Yguk/edit) -¬†_Note_: Try to launch any HDR content to start calibrating, for example just open ""Insects"" Demo or any other HDR game. All Xbox HDR contents will share the calibration;  
¬†
- [**Xbox One/Series X|S, PC + Dolby Vision Suggested Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D62pGcvPfOQN3mh_j11PYwh1thF-JPOu5cHlB9tVzdI/edit?usp=sharing) -¬†_Note_: try to launch any Dolby Vision content to start calibrating, for example just open Netflix app and launch a DV movie. All Xbox Dolby Vision contents will share the calibration;  
¬†
- [**webOS + SDR Suggested Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvUD2Tue-GyQJuCpW3pPAOTZ-YlHhqHKTjf4ri1Ngw4/edit?usp=sharing)¬†-¬†_Note_: try to launch any SDR content to start calibrating, for example just open Netflix app from your LG remote. All webOS SDR contents will share the calibration (with the exception of TV Channels and Media app, which will also be separate);  
¬†
- [**webOS + HDR Suggested Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J7Ov1kKmrA-Z_oyX5Gj4O-YzI_75tboxrKbRNoFOxYM/edit?usp=sharing)¬†-¬†_Note_: try to launch any HDR content to start calibrating, for example just open YouTube app from your LG remote, and search for any HDR videos. All webOS HDR contents will share the calibration (with the exception of TV Channels and Media app, which will also be separate);  
¬†
- [**webOS + Dolby Vision Suggested Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dKwavl6b5eHh9ylQFKBQLD08rhQNcDMEiWnM4J3x6hw/edit?usp=sharing)¬†-¬†_Note_: try to launch any Dolby Vision content to start calibrating, for example open Netflix app from your LG remote, and start playing ""Altered Carbon"" show. All webOS Dolby Vision contents will share the calibration (with the exception of TV Channels and Media app, which will also be separate).

  

These settings are tailor made and compatible with ALL 2017 LG OLEDs variants¬†(e.g. LG B7, C7, E7, G7, W7).

For newer Series' settings, read below.  
¬†  
¬†  
¬†  
**Recommended Settings for LG 2018 OLED Series only:** 
¬†  
Use the same settings for 2017 series above, then apply the following changes:

- SDR Game and SDR ISF Dark presets: bring back Tint to 0;
- HDR Game: set Color value back from 60 to 55; set Dynamic Contrast: OFF; set Dynamic Tone Mapping: ON;
- Dolby Vision: change OLED Light value from 50 to 100.

  
¬†  
¬†  
**Recommended Settings from LG 2019 to 2022 OLED Series:**

**If you have a 2019-2022 LG OLED apply the following changes first, then proceed with the updated Overall Settings Chart below:**  
¬†

- Use ""PC"" HDMI Icon for your HDMI devices in order to unlock 4:4:4 Chroma Subsampling for both SDR and HDR ([Read more](https://www.resetera.com/threads/lg-2017-2022-oleds-optimized-settings-for-xbox-one-series-x-s-ps4-ps5-and-webos-movies-sdr-hdr-dv.73304/post-87028631));

**Xbox HDR Calibration Setup for 2017 HDR Game Mode (Option 1b) or 2017-2022 HDR Game Mode when using DTM (no HGIG):**

- First screen / Min. Luminance: 0 clicks (all the way to the left)
- Second screen / Max Luminance: +54 clicks (starting from 0)
- Third screen / Max Luminance: +54 clicks (starting from 0)

**Xbox HDR Calibration Setup for 2019-2022 HDR Game Mode when using HGIG:**

- First screen / Min. Luminance: 0 clicks (all the way to the left)
- Second screen / Max Luminance: +10 clicks (starting from 0)
- Third screen / Max Luminance: +10 clicks (starting from 0)

&gt; To verify you've correctly calibrated HDR on Xbox HDR Calibration Setup:¬†

Press LT + LB + RT + RB at the same time. Then check in the upper right corner ;)  
¬†(It should be: 0, 4.000, 4.000 for Option 1b/DTM | 0, 800, 800 for HGIG or 0, 1.000, 1.000 for LG G2)  
¬†  
¬†  
**PS5 HDR Calibration Setup for 2017 HDR Game Mode (Option 1b) or 2017-2022 HDR Game Mode when using DTM (no HGIG):**

- First screen / Max Luminance: +25 clicks (starting from 0)
- Second screen / Max Luminance: +25 clicks (starting from 0)
- Third screen / Min. Luminance: 0 clicks (all the way to the bottom)

**PS5 HDR Calibration Setup for 2019-2022 HDR Game Mode when using HGIG:**

- First screen / Max Luminance: +14 clicks (starting from 0)
- Second screen / Max Luminance: +14 clicks (starting from 0)
- Third screen / Min. Luminance: 0 clicks (all the way to the bottom)

  
¬†  
¬†  
Let me know what you think.  
¬†  
Hope you enjoy it :)  
¬†  
Cheers,  
-P  
¬†

  
¬†  
**NOTE:** Don't forget to adjust HDR ""Sliders"" also in game settings if available. Usually, for these TVs, you need to ""increase"" the level of Max HDR Brightness ""Slider"" to make the game logo/icon totally disappear in a white background, or set it to a numerical number around¬†**4.000 nits¬†(for Option 1b or DTM: On/Off)**¬†or¬†**800 nits¬†(for HGIG)**.¬†

**Dolby Vision games**¬†on Xbox + C8/C9/CX/C1/C2 should be set¬†**at¬†1.200 nits**¬†(while¬†**for B7/C7 should be set at¬†10.000 nits!**), but¬†**it is not recommended to game in DV**¬†(see below the Insight about it). 

**Paper White** could be set around **200 nits** in all cases. 


This is the reason why, even with both the console and the TVs properly calibrated, some games may look ""dark"" or ""washed out"" if these settings are left to default.

People used to discount high frame rates in large part, but now consoles finally seem to be capable of delivering a decent performance.

Hopefully it stays that way and devs keep pushing for full frame rates.

PS5,"I finally got a preorder for a PS5! I had to get one for Spidey, aint played it yet, Morales, and upcoming Spidey 2. I initially got the digital one, but canceled it when a disc one popped up. 

I am thinking, I will save money in the long term by buying used discs and reselling them on ebay? Or do the sales come fast and quick after release of their big games?

Most of the time I can wait for digital prices to come down, but even then, I think buying used disc and reselling is much more economical? It is nice just having digital games though, but maybe for big first party games, I dont need them to be digital. I know it will be a while, but I cannot wait for Wolverine! That is such a crazy coup for Sony. 

Do you guys think I should hold onto my series X. The only thing I like about it is, when a cool smaller game comes onto Gamepass, and I find a cheapass code on ebay. But I dont like Xbox first party at all. And I dont like long ass Bethesda RPGs. Somehow I still think maybe I should keep it around.",Shall I get a disc or digital version of PS5?

PS5,"Hello friends,

I just wanted to see if anybody else was having any major problems with their PS5 that is similar to what I am experiencing currently. 
Backstory: I bought a PS5 about 4 months ago and have barely used it because I've been too busy, I initially set it all up downloaded a few games and haven't played any of them. Recently I found myself with some free time and this week I turned my PS5 back on and there was a large software update which I downloaded. Everything was going great last night everything was working I downloaded some new media apps and was mainly just using YouTube and prime video. No games. 

Today the trouble started:
I believe my PS5 was left in sleep mode overnight, and when I went to use it today it's almost as if it will not load any of the apps that I tell it to play. 
It gets stuck in a loading screen and says please wait. 
After various troubleshooting and not even being able to load up a game, I attempted to reset my console. 
After accepting the applicable message it said that it was disconnecting some sort of shared play thing, and was stuck on that screen ( I think it was stuck on this screen I only let it sit for about 10 minutes but I'm guessing that that shouldn't take that long)

Has anybody else experienced any of these problems or does anybody know any hardwired troubleshooting that I can do?

As part of my thesis at the Louvain School of Management in Louvain-La-Neuve (UClouvain), I am conducting a study to get your opinion on digital ownership in the gaming industry. There has been a lot of change over the past 20 years, but not just in the look and feel of the games. Throughout this millennium, we have seen significant changes in the types of games available, how we buy them and even how we play them. With almost $300 billion worth of revenue, the gaming industry is poised for even further growth. The purpose of this survey is to collect the opinion of a much as possible gamers. Whether you play every day or once a month, whether you play on console, PC or mobile you are invited to answer. **The questionnaire is only 2 pages and should take between 2 and 5 minutes.**

PS5,"This is driving me bandanas and I've tried contacting both playstation help and Disney plus help.

So I have 2 PS5s. I had one since launch and I just recently got one for my family. The new one refuses to update Disney plus. I'll outline all the troubleshooting steps we've taken.

I've reinstalled the app multiple times. I've logged out of all devices and relogged in. I've turned off the console, the router, and the modem in order to get a new ipadress. I've started in safe mode to clear the cache. I've updated the system software to the newest one and verified that it's installed because there is the option for vrr. I've turned HDR off on the TV. I've tried to force an update by using the options button on the media tab.

On the playstation screen when I try to force the update it says it's already been updated to the latest. If I look at the app from the media screen or the app screen in the ps5 ui it says it's version 3.20, but when I actually open Disney plus and go to the settings it's version 1.22 and I can confirm this because it only goes up to HD and automatic will only let me stream up to 4GB instead of the 7GB on the other ps5

The interface is slightly different and there is no mention of any 4K content. Not just that but I doubt it's even streaming in HD because it looks terrible. It looks like SD to me. It's very frustrating because it would look better streaming off of a sketchy website but I pay to subscribe legitimately because I don't want any issues. Anyone have any ideas as to why it's not working?",Disney+ is at version 1.22 but the current version is 3.20

I could get another controller that is faulty for parts, but that is pretty expensive and I want to avoid it. Any sites that I can order the whole trigger/bumper mechanism? I can assemble it as long as it doesn't need soldering.",ps5 trigger replacement parts

- Can I game share and PS+ share with my GF if I'm on PS4 and she's on PS5?

- If I bought a game via the PS store on my PS4, can I log in on PS5 and still play those games both by myself and with others on PS4/PS5, or do I have to get a separate version?

PS5,"I love the PS5 controller. I thought the haptic feedback sounded like a gimmick before I experienced it for myself but it really adds another layer to gameplay. After reading some of the rumors about a pro controller, I'm curious to know what Sony could do to set it apart from the competition. 

I also own an Elite 2 controller to use on PC, and tbh I love it just as much as the Dualsense. Depending on what type of game I'm playing, I might choose the Elite over the Dualsense. I cannot stand to play any fps without paddles now. 
Although, I'm going to have to for a couple weeks while I wait for my Elite 2 warranty process (stick drift).

So what can this rumored Dualsense Pro do to make me choose it over another contoller?
Keep the haptic feedback, sure.
Paddles, removable joysticks, trigger locks etc are all pretty standard by now.
My imagination struggles to come up with something they could add that no one else is doing at the moment.

What do you guys think? What games would you buy a pro controller for? Do you think they'd try to match or undercut the price of the Elite controller? 

Let me know! I'm honestly dying for more news so wild speculation will have to do for now.","What would you want in a ""Pro"" controller?"

PS5,"I've had the PS5 for under a year and nearly all of my games are unplayable offline or online. Specifically I have been lagging about every 3 mins on NBA 2k... everything will be normal and then randomly ill have a huge lag spike, frames will skip and then its back to normal for another 3 mins. Has anyone else had this issue? Happens on Apex and GTA San Andreas too. Last time this happened to my PS4 it was a hard drive issue. Kind of a shame such an expensive and hard to get console has burnt out on me in less than a year for the second generation in a row. Really considering switching to Xbox üò≠üò≠",Lag Issues (and Rant sort of)
PS5,"I was one of those poor fools who got duped into buying CP2077 on the PS4 at launch.  Endured the utter horror of the sub 1080p blurry as hell image.  The sub 30 gameplay.  And Holy shit the bugs.  I remember trying to keep count of all the bugs I saw while just standing around outside the main apartment at the start of the game.  Stopped at 50.  

Once the ability to get the refund happened I jumped at that and got my money back. 

Now here I am with a shiny new PS5 and while playing through and having an incredible time with my library both new titles and old alike, decided well what the hell.  Let's see how this game is now.  

Welp.  Yeah its much better than it was for certain.  No question there.  Imagine quality is great most of the time and the 60fps gameplay is amazing.  But damn.  It's plain frustrating how buggy the game still is.  

The most frustrating thing is most of the bugs seem to be within actual missions.  Trying to stay immersed In this amazing world while running missions with Jackie or Judy or Panam or whomever and it's impossible as the game just throws bugs left and right.  Audio miscues, like just did a mission with Panam where we stole a vehicle and the entire rest of the mission the vehicles horn was going off.  Nonstop.  Then I see her glitch out of the car on several occasions and float around.  Animations pop around alot.  Mission triggers seem to not have any sort of sync so no matter what is going on the animations will all reset suddenly and go to mission start animations.  Feet not hitting the ground.  Cars just don't act right unless they are the main one at times.  Jumping around or having very odd physics reactions with the environment.  

And this type of list could be said for just about every mission.  Speech cutting out or the cinematics messing up.  Odd jumps in animation alot of the time.  Had several crashes.  Once during a mission the game lost the ability to save properly so the save icon was up at all times, it completely lost sync and had to be hard reset and reloaded.  Shadows still have a bad way of popping in and out while walking or driving around.  And good lord the shadows on people walking around with the RT mode is a joke.  Like little black blobs underneath everyone that have ghosting effects when the people's feet move in and out of the black blob.  

Been gaming a long time, seen a ton of buggy games, but this one man.  This one is special.  It has been this long with this many patches and whatnot and the game still can't even run a main mission without bugs getting in the way of the experience.  Almost an impressive display honestly.

Atleast it runs at 60 though.  There is that.  But phew.  It's shocking it is still this bad after this long","Amazing, Cyberpunk 2077 is still buggy as hell"

I was trying to watch a movie on my ps5 via Apple‚Äôs streaming app, and having seen it before I couldn‚Äôt help but notice it seemed washed out or like the brightness was too high.

I switched to the same app in my tv and noticed a big difference- even the icons in the app menu popped with colour compared to the washed out PS5.

I pulled up a few test patterns on the YouTube app via both ps5 and my tv, and it seems like the white isn‚Äôt getting very bright on the ps5, the white clips much earlier than it does via the tv app.

I‚Äôve tried recalibrating the HDR, nothing seems to be any different.

PS5,"Those with a ps5, wouldn't the adaptive triggers actually be better for shooters? Since analog triggers have come out, it's better for other genre of games such as driving games or other creative games like LBP. But for shooters I feel like there's the issue of not getting the feedback of when the button is actually pressed. Most shooters only require you to go half way the trigger for the game to respond, so when shooting fast with a pistol or something, it can get a little bit weird trying to shoot fast and hit that middle spot consistently. I've seen that with games like call of duty or any shooter, the dualsense triggers kind of stop in the middle,.then give in once there's enough pressure. So wouldn't that actually provide a more tactical experience? I hear a lot of people complaining that it hinders their performance so they take it off. Do any of you guys just leave it on??",Adaptive Triggers better for shooters???

PS5,"They brought so much things to the table.

The amount of work, energy and crunch times that must have been spent on this garbage pile is staggering. 
 
The world is huge. And yet so empty and tiring. 

The setting is incredibly cool and yet their take is the most cookie cutter uninspired joke of a rendition. 

The story is extremely long.
And yet I couldn't care less about any of those characters. 

There are an infinite amount of voice lines but they compressed it for some reason making the game a torture to listen to. 

There are a lot of different things to do and yet doing any of them is an absolute chore. 

I'm still not sure what kind of personality Eivoir is meant to have.
You meet so many people that all look the same, it's impossible to remember who they are when they do callbacks. 

The fights are the best part of the game but get so repetitive. The exploration and climbing is horrible and clunky as usual. The game holds you by the hand all game long except when it just doesn't explain shit about that one gameplay detail for whatever reason. 

Like at least, fix the basic ergonomics of your menus and inventory before you go ahead and make such a behemoth of boredom and pain.",Valhalla is the worst game I've ever played

PS5,"[I really like the ‚Äúspecial‚Äù or ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù physical versions ](https://i.imgur.com/v7rDHnF.jpg)of the Sony exclusive games. I was hoping they continue to make them and with Horizon Forbidden West having one I was really happy and taught they will continue to make them for PS5 first party games. 
They where a good middle ground between the standard edition and the often much more pricey and limited collectors editions. Most if not all of these ‚Äúspecial‚Äù editions cost 10‚Ç¨ as the standard version more but you get all the deluxe DLC plus a nice little Artbook and a Steelbook. I really appreciated this because it was something nice and not to expensive. 

Sadly it looks like the deluxe version of God of War Ragnar√∂k is only available as a digital version. 

What are you guys thinking? 

If there won‚Äôt be a physical deluxe edition for Ragnar√∂k (still having hope that they have one but for some strange reasons only showed the digital deluxe) I simply will buy it digitally because the standard is just the disc and the collectors will be way to expensive with stuff that is too much for me.",So there is no physical ‚ÄúDeluxe‚Äù edition for God of War Ragnar√∂k?

PS5,"I can't believe I never noticed this. By selecting ""soundbar"" for audio I have been missing out on true surround sound. 

I normally don't wear headphones but bought the ps pulse headphones and decided to try them out. While playing ghost of tsushima there were a ton of sounds I wasn't hearing through my soundbar. Rain drops, other birds, far dialog etc. So I googled it and found this.

Navigate to the Sound settings menu and select Audio Output. Select the HDMI Device Type as ‚ÄúAV Amplifier‚Äù ‚Äî this might seem strange when there‚Äôs a separate ‚ÄúSound Bar‚Äù option available, but you‚Äôll need the former option for true surround sound.

I tried this and works great.  Nothing like I've heard before.

PS5,"There's one thing that I don't see people complaining about.

When Sony revealed the addition of classic games on the premium/deluxe tiers of ps+, they told us on PS Blog that classic games that we owned previously should be accessible, even if we don't subscribe to premium. That is ""partially"" true though...

I own since the old PS3/PSP days quite a lot of psone and PSP games that are listed on the new premium catalogue as well, and they are indeed downloadable without subscription to the new tier (e.g. Syphon filter, wild arms, oddworld, etc.), At the same time, some of the games listed that I previously owned, are not available to me (e.g. resident evil DC, echochrome, etc.)

Anyone else noticed this issue? (US store btw...)

P.S. I don't think this should be normal, but since most people interested in retro games are most likely subscribing to premium, they are probably not realizing this issue...",Regarding PS one and PSP classics on PS4/5 and pre ownership

PS5,"Hey

So i'm visiting a friend overseas at the moment, logged into my profile on his console, and all my games are locked, both physical (obviously) digital. Every single game.

Back home i was game/console sharing with my little brother so he could play FIFA on his PS5 too on his account, however when i decided to go overseas we stopped the game sharing (i think?), also deleted my profile off his account too.

But every single game is locked on my friends PS5 who i am with overseas right now. Does anyone have any ideas? Did i do a wrong console/game sharing option on my brothers PS5 before i left?

I just want to play FIFA with my friend when we're home lol

And yes, he has game sharing enabled and restore licenses didn't work.

PS5,"I am ridiculously pissed off right now. I live in Canada, but am working in the US for the summer. I do not have my mobile phone plan active for this time as I always have wifi and am in an area with no service. I have been trying to sign in to my PSN account through my phone to redeem PS plus games and possibly purchase something if it goes on sale.

Unfortunately I have 2 factor authentication on, tied to my mobile phone, so I cannot sign in as I don‚Äôt receive the texts. That‚Äôs fine, maybe I can contact Sony and get this fixed. No online chat, or any info relating to changing or cancelling 2SV online, fine. I can deal with calling.

After navigating their prehistoric ‚Äúpress 1 for more options‚Äù nightmare paging system, I finally get to someone after 45mins of being on hold. I give them info about my account - recent transactions, payment info, etc. I answer all questions with no problem, and the guy says ‚Äúokay, thank you for answering these questions. I will send you an email with more questions as we need more information‚Äù. Why can‚Äôt you ask me now? Whatever‚Ä¶ at least I have the PlayStation support email now so I can continuously work with support to solve this.

The fucking email is a ‚Äúdo not reply‚Äù email and it tells me all information that I already provided and only tells me to provide that info over the phone again.

PS5,"I know alot of people out there are also getting their brand new PS5s now that stock is starting to pick up.  I myself got one yesterday and have had the joy of the new gen experience for the past night.  Upgrading old games, grabbing brand new free games from Plus Extra, buying others.  All that fun stuff. 

Thankfully Sony threw in Astros Playroom to mess with while everything else was downloading.   Amazing experience that one is really, my family and I had alot of fun with it.  Really great introduction to the Dualshock controller while also showing off how that SSD streamlines the play experience by basically eliminating loads.  

While that game was great.   I have to say.  Returnal might be the greatest early game I've ever played on a system.  For HouseMarque to pull off this kind of quality in essentially every single area of development so quickly with new hardware and on their first attempt with a AAA project, it's extraordinary.   Everything is just amazing.  Fantastic use of the controller.  The way the triggers feel while blasting away. The way L2 works with the trigger lock mechanisms to utilize it for aim or secondary fire.  Amazing.  

The graphics are clean and amazing.  The framerate is smooth and perfectly showcases the benefits of 60fps on a console experience.   The particle effects, traversal effects, enemy effects, etc. are all vibrant and great looking.  The UI and map system are fantastic.  At times feels a bit like Metroid Prime mixed with Alienation mixed with a bullet hell arcade game.   Great sense of adventure and discovery throughout. 

And man what an audio showcase.  Holy shit.  Perhaps the best audio I've ever heard in a videogame.  Everything is so punchy.  So much ambience and so much feel to the sound.  The sound of your alt fire recharging.  The sound of your shots reverberating around an enclosed area or the sound of shots ricocheting around an area.  The enemy sounds all being very unique including audio clues to various attacks.  

Then you have the fact that despite all this high quality stuff everywhere there is 0 loading that takes you out of the game.  No load screens or black screens you stare at for 20+ seconds.   Fast travel is done by animations.  Even jumping to a whole new biome is just a few seconds.  Amazing.  Really returns me to the cartridge era.  

This game really showcases pretty much every aspect of the system.  The fact that it was free on PS+ was just icing on that cake.","Returnal is the best "" Welcome to New System "" game I've ever played"

PS5,"So basically I had a subscription to an MMO and went online to find that if I wanted to cancel, I would need to check my Subscriptions in either the account management or the app.

I checked both. It wasnt there, so I assumed I was in the clear. There was no record that my sub was recurring.

Then I got charged. I contacted Sony about it like.. where is this subscription?  I can't cancel it and already went through hoops to make sure it wasnt active?

Well, they told me that it was invisible due to an error they were looking into.

They cancelled the sub apparently (not that it would look any different on my end.) But they refuse to givr me a refund.

I was totally polite both times I contacted them, though direct about this being bullshit as I didn't even see (due to their own error) that my sub was active.) But not only did they refuse, they ended the chat BOTH times on me as I was typing about.. why cant I at least get a credit to my account for this ""error""?

Basically at this point theyre telling me to piss off and deal with it. God damn it it makes me furious BECAUSE i did everything in my power to be proactive and not forget about this sub and cancel it.",basically just got told to 'eff off' by PSN support chat over unauthorized charge

This def has some performance issues but dang it‚Äôs really fun.  There are a lot of things to do- sense of speed is really great.  The first person to me, at least on MX is really immersive.

The tracks are really great.  Vast hills, small hills, canyons, long distances.

And when I played the series I usually stick to MX stuff but the little bit of ATV / UTV was pretty thrilling.  

Unfortunately in busier sections it drops down from 60 but if ya can take that- to me this is the best in the series.  Huge areas and track designs great.  Some customization, just don‚Äôt go into expecting a ton.

Really surprised me- sense of speed is really great and the particle effects of carving is always fun to see.  Especially when it‚Äôs a pact turn.

Cheers",MX vs ATV legends some of the best tracks of the series
PS5,"I‚Äôm currently paid up thru 10/2026 with the basic PS+ tier (Essential).  And I‚Äôm debating on whether or not to upgrade to Extra or Premium, as I have to convert the entire years worth of subscription all at once.

I‚Äôve seen talk about not being able to stack, but I‚Äôm not sure if that refers to the basic tier or the Extra/Premium.  Figured I‚Äôd add another year or two and then upgrade to one of the higher tiers, assuming it‚Äôs still $149 for Premium and $100 for Extra.

I read the FAQ and it looks like you‚Äôd get the full 365 days for a PS+ Card converted to the basic ‚ÄúEssential‚Äù tier but I could be reading it wrong.  I‚Äôd really appreciate any information from people that have already tried this or have a better understanding of the new system.

For Call of Duty Modern warfare, it said I needed 110+gigs of free space for an update that was only 30. This is getting really annoying, and I have no idea why this is happening.

PS5,"My current subscription was scheduled to renew next week on July 9th. I had upgraded to PS+ Extra when it launched and wanted to see if CDkeys would work and how the process would go, given that the codes typically only cover the Essential plan.

I bought a 12 month code from CDkeys yesterday and redeemed it on my PS5 and it worked!

However, since I was already subscribed to the Extra plan, the new code added time for 8 months instead of 12. I assume this is to cover the higher cost of the extra tiers which isn't a huge deal considering I paid $48 USD to cover 8 months, or $6 per month. The original Extra cost is $99 USD for 12 months, or a little over $8 per month so you still save money in the long run.

TL/DR: 12month CDkey PS+ subscriptions appear to cover less than 12 months, depending on your current subscription, but are still worth it at their current price.",PSA regarding PS+ subscriptions from CDkeys for use on higher tiers

PS5,"See picture. So after installing an SSD into my PS5 and booting it up, all I got was a black screen. I go to take out the SSD and long story short, the screw head was stripped and I could not get it out.  With some help, the top of the screw was sawed off, and I got the SSD out, but now this is stuck in the PS5. Any one can tell me how I could get it out? You can probably see the little indention where I tried to make a flathead screwdriver work but that was a no-go.  PS5 works now since removing the SSD but I want to try again with a working SSD.

PS5,"I was lucky enough to get a PS5 but I have literally only used it for playing PS4 games on higher settings

I haven't seen a single game that interests me while PS4 had games like the Far Cry Map Editor or Skyrim or No Man's Sky which I've spent thousands of hours between. And PS3 had the best physics-based game ever, Red Faction: Guerrilla, which Just Cause doesn't come close to. 

I don't really like average FPS games (CoD or most Battlefields) or linear story games (Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Uncharted, Batman, etc etc). I prefer open world RPGs, something with a creative element, or games which use physics really well to create destructible environments (RF:G is the only game in that category but I really like it).

I'm going to pick up Elden Ring but otherwise I haven't seen a single game that looks good. ""Best PS5 games of 2022"" lists often still include Astro's Playroom, the launch day tech demo! You know that's a bad sign. 

Does PS5 really have only a single game that I might like? At this rate this might be my last gen with Sony after buying their consoles since the PS2.",Am I missing all the good PS5 games?

PS5,,can I on any way get bo2 on ps5
PS5,"
I‚Äôm about half way through Forbidden West and just can‚Äôt take it anymore. The game‚Äôs failure to take any risk and just stay on it‚Äôs dated, stale path is just too much. It‚Äôs definitely a sequel to Zero Dawn as that took no risk and was just a Ubisoft like stale open world title. I remember when Zero Dawn came out and an article released stating how Breathe of the Wild, which also came out at that time, had an open world that took risk and made Horizon seem pretty mediocre. I‚Äôm sure Guerilla seen that article but learned nothing. People are tired of these copy and paste, lazy by the book open world titles. Elden Ring being an insanely flawed game but having those flaws ignored simply because they rejected the tired ‚Äútraditional‚Äù open world format is proof. Guerrilla was at their best when they made Killzone 2. Sony is in desperate need of a FPS so I‚Äôm hoping Guerrilla goes back to what made them great. A Killzone reboot with KZ2 as the blueprint would be a much better direction than another ‚Äúgreat concept, average execution‚Äù Horizon title.",It‚Äôs time for Guerilla to move on

PS5,"So, this has been bugging me for a while. I'm going to head this off by saying that I'm an IT guy with over 20 years of experience in various IT domains and networking is one of them.

I have an Asus RT-AX58u router that has both 2.4 and 5GHz enabled. Within the same home/apartment I also have a residential Wifi AP. Here's what's been happening with my PS5 ever since I've had it:

I turn on the PS5, and it will say I am offline. I check the network settings, and it won't show ANY SSIDs at all. Scanning for networks shows nothing. It should be showing:
 - My router's SSID
 - My apartment community's Resident Wifi
 - My apartment community's Guest Wifi
 - Next-door neighboor's Wifi broadcasting capable devices (printers, routers, extenders, etc)

And these following steps will work intermittently, or not at all to get the WNIC to connect to the appropriate SSID:
 - Restart PS5
 - Put the PS5 in Rest Mode
 - Shut the PS5 down
 - Completely power cycling by unplugging the PS5 from power and pressing the power button to clear any charge from the PS5

It is getting rather frustrating to come home, turn on the PS5 from rest mode, to find that it lost connection to the network. I'd perform the above 4 steps, sometimes for up to 20 minutes, trying to get it to recognize ANY available SSIDs at all.

Is there a known issue with the PS5's NIC's to not initialize properly??? I have a hard time finding any resources online that discuss this... so I feel like I'm about to have to get Sony to service this thing. But, before I do, I wanted to see with the community if anyone else has had this issue.",Wifi Adapter not initializing

Does anyone have some clue when this game will go on sale? I've been playing a library copy recently and really like it, which surprised me. But multiplayer kinda sucks as I rarely find people to summon and as unlikely I get summoned. Apparently this is a player base issue? If so, you'd expect a sale to increase that player base. On the other hand, it's been so popular that they may just continue to milk it for full price.

Oddly, I started playing FFX-HD and it was working fine the whole time but then when I go back into COD is stops working again.

Combine protection and fire together to make fire enemies give you tremendous health whenever they use fire attacks.

You can even mix more than two to make even crazier combinations all while fighting orcs and goblins etc together. Careful *Friendly fire is on*.

You have like 8 different elements and have 4 different ways to apply them. The possibilities are crazy. Please try it.","If you never tried Magicka 2 yet that is free on PS Now, give it a try"
PS5,"Finally got my hands on a PS5. One of the games jammed into the ""Fuck You, you know you're still gonna buy it...""-package I begrudgingly purchased was 'Battlefield 2042'. I've played the OG classics, Hardline was bad but playable, 1 was thin but fun &amp; V was a good time (loved the tanks!)... 2042 is an abomination. 

The menus are an absolute mess and navigating them gets me closer to having a seizure than any of the piss poor graphics ever could. Speaking of which, whoever OK'd the final rendering of this game should be excommunicated from the gaming industry and the artists themselves should really consider other work. So many glitches too...

The weapon selection is pathetic, you get more options at a Bed and Breakfast. The ability to swap attachments mid game is pretty sweet, but again who cares when there's only 7 guns in the game. The class system has potential, but the crap menu layout makes it super confusing to navigate and I just lose interest.  Why would you assign so many different buttons to navigate a damn menu? I feel like I'm trying to solve a Rubik's cube changing a weapon load out.

The maps are massive but designed almost as if they don't want you to use vehicles... And the vehicles! Why are there so few! And why are there fewer options than ever?! Weak sauce EA... Speaking of which... Fuck EA.

For a system that's supposed to afford endless possibility, I feel really handcuffed to a style of play that just isn't fun in a game that doesn't even feel rushed, feels incomplete. Was really looking forward to a new Battlefield but I'm trading this in for whatever they'll give me. 

Says it all that they had to ham-hand it into package deals. Thankfully it included Elden Ring too. That way I can play a game designed by people vested in providing their customers with a quality product. Fuck EA, their brand killing greed &amp; shitty products.",(Rant) Battlefield 2042 is an embarrassment to PS5 and Gamers

PS5,"I enjoy the game, I enjoy the esthetic, the ambiance... but the story killed it for me. 

The game is smooth like butter. It took my one death to feel like I'd been playing for hours. The atmosphere of the game is amazing. I was getting some nice Lovecraft feels from it. It only took a few days to raise i wasn't going to finish it, I'm not usually a fan of roguelikes, but I have PS plus, so it was free. I little tidbits of plot the game gave me left me very intrigued so I hit up YouTube for a plot explanation video and that's when it really killed the game for me. 

Spoilers past this point. 

&gt;!Ok so the entire time I was getting those Lovecraft vibes I was excited. I was picturing some ancient evil awakening, some nether God that drove all the beings on the planet insane. Totally hooked. !&lt;

&gt;!Then I find out the whole things is in her head because she feels guilty for inadvertently causing the death of her daughter and being unable to save her. I felt ripped off. I wanted deities of unimaginable horrer psychically decimating every kind on a planet and delving further and further into the mental apocalypse that was there home...!&lt;

PS5,"This is obviously my opinion so just keep that in mind.  


I've been a PlayStation first player since the early PS3-era, when the platform / first party was in the dumpster, and I was having lunch-time arguments in 8th grade about the merits of Folklore / Lair, over the likes of Gears of War and Bioshock...so in case anyone wants to question my bonafides there ya go.  


# Sony's 1st party output is getting predictable and boring, and Ghost of Tsushima / Horizon are not nearly as good as you all say they are.

&amp;#x200B;

Some would claim that this started with the success of Uncharted and The Last of Us, but those games are phenomenal, and completely unlike the string of boring, predictable, safe, focus-tested, lifeless first-party exclusives they've come out with in the last several years.   


Horizon Zero Dawn  
Days Gone  
Ghost of Tsushima  
Horizon Forbidden West  
These games are all extremely similar structurally. Open worlds with lots of icons, objectives, gameplay variation...most of them have stealth grass, crafting, stealth kills, special melee finishers, loot, gear upgrades, skill trees, weapon upgrades...the list of familiar gameplay mechanics goes on and on. If you take away the window dressing of ""Samurai game"" or ""Robot dinosaur game"" or ""Zombie game"", they are almost identical in their design and gameplay, which is THE most important thing.

There are so many missions in Ghost that are trailing missions, or following footsteps...only to have a bunch of Mongol's be put in your way...you dispatch them and then the mission is usually over.

Horizon, despite having extremely awkward jumping and platforming, insists on making the player play dozens of missions that focus almost solely around jumping and platforming. Climbing on pre-determined, auto-win paths is not fun...it was the worst part of Uncharted and now it's in every Sony game. You want to see a game that did it right? Breath of The Wild...and I know that Guerrilla knows this game exists because they stole the glider mechanic straight from it.  


# Just because a game has a lot of dialogue and cutscenes doesn't mean the story / characters are good.

Aloy is one of the most insufferable game protagonists to come around in a long time. She is rude, humorless, talks down to people constantly, has no respect for the people around her, and worst of all she never shuts up or lets the player just play the game. I'd be rich if I had a quarter every time Aloy told a villager essentially, ""Shut up and let me handle this situation you toothless hillbilly...IF I HAVE TIME"". Who wants to play a game where the main character is an asshole to everyone?  


Jin Sakai, while not as much of an asshole as Aloy, is boring and bland as hell. He's conflicted about samurai vs ninja, but no matter what you do in the game, your choices don't matter and he ends up becoming a ninja anyway. Outside of being conflicted...what other terms would you use to describe Jin?  


Don't get me wrong - I think gaming is in a stronger place now than it's been in a long time, but god some of these games are so boring it makes my head spin.",Sony's 1st party output is getting predictable and boring.

No hits or emails back and she said maybe we should call stores and see if they have any. I decided to try the Gamestop I used to go to a few years ago, before I started solely downloading games to my ps4's upgraded ssd. I asked if they have any disc drive PS5 consoles? The nice lady says ""yes we do."" I was floored, my oldest son didn't believe me! I asked them to hold it for me under my name and I would be there shortly. My wife says she can order an extra controller via Amazon if they don't have the color we want. 

I get there and its fairly busy and my heart sinks a little because I have put stuff on hold at Gamestop and it was sold before I got there (not this store in particular) and it bummed me out. I get to the nice associate and explain to her that I have a PS5 on hold. She starts to ring up my order from a big 3 ring binder with all the sku #s in it. It comes up to around $860! Looking at the little breakdown I see like 4 games, an extra red controller (not the color we wanted), and a charging station. I said ""Thats not my order I am here for the disc drive PS5."" She says all they sell are the bundles. I got pretty upset, because that was way beyond the budget we had in min.  Two games in the bundle I already had and the third of four I didnt want at all (Battlefield). I call home and tell my Wife and she says, ""tell them you don't want those games.""  I am pretty un-confrontational and there is a line behind me. I get too nervous and I leave. My wife gives me this pep talk saying, to tell the employee that the lady on the phone didn't say that it was a bundle. We had planned on buying games digitally anyway. So my wife said to see if they could do a swap out of all the games I didn't want for ones I did. All they can say is no and we can try calling other stores for the console only if they couldn't break-up the bundle. I waited until the store cleared out and I get back up to the same girl and say, ""I'm sorry but I'm pretty disappointed. I'm not mad at you, but I called and wasn't told this was only bundled PS5's. I already own Horizon, and this other game. I don't want these games. Can I break the bundle and choose the games I'm getting so I will at least get the games I want?"" She doesn't say a word and looks irritated, but she busts out the binder and starts ringing me up. I look and not only were they games I had no interest in or games I had already they were the super duper editions at $89, $79, etc. overpriced! I sai, ""I'd love Ratchet and Clank, my son wants Elden Ring, and ideally instead of red remote I'd prefer the purple."" She just quietly rung up and grabbed everything I asked for. She said she cannot take off the charging station, but that is OK for me. The total ended up being $780 with sales tax (8.35%), but I got 2 games and the controller I wanted, with the charging station. So in the end I got what I wanted and they got their sale. I just wanted to share my experience so you know there is potential for customizing these bundles at Gamestop. Another requirement was that you were a Pro member, so I did have to pay $15 to add that for the year, but with the renewal points and purchase  points I will already have a $20 credit to use on my next purchase.

I have tried the SteelSeries 7p+ ($170), just to have everything in the background comes through. Recently tried the SteelSeries Nova Pro Wireless ($350), Just to sound low in my opinion unless I cranked it up in settings. Which allows more background noise to appear. Once again not practical to me. Without waiting for the PS5 version of Astros to drop. Which could be another year or two. 

Is there anything remotely good currently? That blocks out the background noise and only allows in your voice basically? Or close to it? The Pulse does a decent good job, but given the mic is built in, I sound like shit compared to the A40s or the Nova Pro Wireless.",Best microphone for the PS5?

PS5,"So far the library of PS1 and PS2 is sparse. And personally I have no interest in the PS3 library through PS+ because my internet does not have the speeds to handle it. But if you have played Ape Escape 2 you'll notice a few things, that one it's the version that was ported to PS4 years ago when they did a short list of PS2 games for the PS4 early on the PS4's life. And two, it's broken on PS5 and they acknowledge that with a warning when you boot the game up which says to me that Sony knows that it's messed up on PS5. 

But why did I have hope they'll fix it? Because as said, the PS2 games that are on the service right now are the porter PS5 versions. For example Okage is the PS4 ported version dated from 2016. If you see the Jak and Daxter games they are also from the PS4 collection that was released awhile back. Unlike something like Ape Escape (the PSX original) that is dated for 6/13/22 here in the states, released again for this service. So I think that any further PS2 releases for PS+ will released for their service specifically, and again not like the few games they ported a few years ago on PS4. I think they'll fix Ape Escape 2 once they actually start getting to the PS2 games which will probably come with things like save states etc like we've seen with the PS1 titles.

And hopefully we'll finally get a rerelease of Ape Escape 3 since they rated it again back in 2020, but didn't release anything.","Ape Escape 2 is a mess on PS5, but why I have hope it will be fixed"

PS5,"Hello everyone, today the new PlayStation Plus subscription came out in Italy and with it also the (few) PS1, PSP, PS2 and PS3 games in emulation.

Now guys, that's all well and good, I don't want to blurt out on the PlayStation Plus topic, really I swear I'm okay with literally everything and everyone has their own opinion about it....but, holy HELL, but will you please explain to me what is the point of giving us """"""free"""" PS1 AND PSP games purchased digitally at the time, while PS2 AND PS3 games are not? I swear to you guys, I feel taken for a ride in an unbelievable way.

Either they were doing it for all consoles or not at all, but I say what's the point of doing it like this, half-heartedly, just for the content to make people feel good?

I am dumbfounded, I repeat I'm really okay with anything, 120$  a year for two games in a cross TO ME IS OK, everyone can choose whether to do it or not, no one is obligated....but there is a f\*cking limit to the transparency a company can have, and this is really one of the most treacherous and disgusting moves I've ever seen.

And don't tell me ""if you want to play PS2 and PS3 games you bought on the Store at the time get yourself a PS3"" because that's not the point, the point is the disrespect towards their fanbase, the wanting to take advantage of every last penny.

Sorry, I needed to vent, I am speechless. Sorry for the bad English.","PS1 and PSP games free, while PS2 and PS3 games not"

Remember: Please do not refresh your screen as it will disconnect the chat session. Thanks!

Me:Me: Hello, I am in the ps5 invitation event right now but the link I got in my email is not working. I either get a \&amp;quot;We cannot direct you to the requested web page at this time. Please try again.\&amp;quot; message or a \&amp;quot;bad request\&amp;quot; message. I have tried multiple browsers and cleared my cache Me: Bad Request - Invalid URL HTTP Error 400. The request URL is invalid. Me: is the other result

Me:copy paste from the other person i just spoke with

Me:basically the link i got for the ps5 event seems to be broken

Erick:We‚Äôre very sorry to read that and allow me to explain, at the moment you are contacting PS tech support and unfortunately we don‚Äôt have all the proper tools to help you with your specific situation. Allow me point you to the right direction. You have to contact PS direct support chat here: [https://psdirect.com/chat](https://psdirect.com/chat)

At the bottom you will see the option to chat with them. In case you see the option is grayed out, that means their chat waiting queue is at max capacity so my recommendation for you would be wait for the option to become available so you can start to chat with them. They will be more than glad to help you!  

Do you have any other question for me or something else I could help?

Erick:Thank you for contacting PlayStation, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day

  
Guy disconnected before I could say anything.  Shockingly, the direct support button is greyed out.  And I continue to have no solution to actually buy this thing, or even verify if my link is working.  I'm blown away by how badly this is going through the official channel to buy a PS5.  To be clear, I get that these guys were just doing their jobs, I just don't know what Sony is expecting me to do here.",Is this for real? I got the magic email and I'm still out of luck

PS5,"Far Cry 6 has a fun story and the characters are pretty excellent. There is a lot of heart in Far Cry 6's narrative, but the open world has no real soul, and the UI feels sluggish and dated.

Simply put, the things you do in the open world and how you are meant to traverse it--are monotonous. We all know what Ubisoft games are like so there's no need to go into great detail here.

I want to talk briefly about the UI.

When you start the game, you always get a voiced menu-narrator that says ""Press cross to start"" or something like that. At first it's like, cool accessibility. But you never have the option of turning it off. That's a little thing though, right?

But once you're in the game you start seeing those lazy design choices like having to enter the pause menu every time you want to switch your supremo device. Or having to drag your cursor around the menu screen to select things like you're playing with a mouse and keyboard. Or having to enter the pause menu again if you want to dismiss your companion.

What annoys me most though is how the main character can only grab certain ledges in the game. I frequently find myself stand right next to a fence or stairwell or rock that I can't climb because the game wants me to find the yellow painted wall that I'm allowed to climb to reach an item or vantage point. This is just egregious and a huge step back as far as modern open world games are concerned.

This game feels like such a contrast to Far Cry 5 which I feel had a really good balance of open world distractions and mission design; I was never really bored with Far Cry 5. (Hopefully it gets a console update).

I know this is all over the place.

TL/DR: Far Cry 6 is a waste of time.","I should love Far Cry 6, but I kind of hate it."

PS5,"So. Back in June 2021 I was lucky enough to get myself a PS5 (disc version) console for RRP without really trying that hard if I'm honest.

Flash forward from June 2021 to May of this year. The 12th to be exact. A day that will haunt me.

I had just installed Evil Dead The Game (E/D) and the new PS5 firmware update - like many people had I assume.

20 mins into E/D and the PS5 screen went black, an almighty ""scream"" type audio rumbled out of the speakers on my TV and the PS5 went off.

""Okay. That was weird. Damn game.""

Turned it back on and loaded E/D back up again. 

4 or 5 minutes later...

Green screen. PS5 powers off.

""What a dogsh** game!""

Threw the game back in the cupboard and put (I'm ashamed to say) Fortnite on. Played for 2 or 3 hours. No issues. 

A couple of days pass, maybe a week, during which I'm discussing E/D with some mates and how annoying it is that the game is unplayable.

""Huh?"" ""What?"" ""Mine doesn't crash."" ""I've not had any problems.""

Not what I wanted to hear.

I do a bit of research. 

'PS5 green screen....' comes back with issues ranging from software, HDMI leads popping out or a bad GPU.

I keep telling myself that it was the game - Fortnite was okay. No issues at all. I decided I'm going to test it out again. I don't even get past E/Ds loading screen this time. Green screen. Power off.

I reset the console. Same issue.
I option 7 the console. Same issue.

ONLY with E/D.

I'm playing Far Cry 6, Valhalla, Fortnite, all without issue.

To be on the safe side I contact Sony through their online portal. 

I ask them outright if the firmware has caused this. Knowing a few people have had firmware issues previously.

They tell me to send it back if I like because it ""might"" be broken. Even though I'm playing it. 

""What!?""

They give me a case number. Let's say 666X666 and instructions on how to package my PS5 for return. (I'm in the UK - They give you a label and nothing else.)

There's no way it's broken though. I'm playing it whilst reading their email. How can they say it might not work when I'm literally playing it?

Flash another week. It's playing everything except E/D.

June 10th 2022. Or as I now call it. 

Sony PlayStation Fried-day.

It's 0830 and I just got in from a night shift. Figured I'd do some looting and shooting before bed so I turn it on. Fortnite loads because I want something easy.

30 seconds later. Green screen. Power off. Reboot. 30 seconds. The same. Reboot. 20 seconds. Black screen. (That's new). Power off.

I pull the leads out. Use a whole roll of bubble wrap and mail the PS5 at 1032 in the morning. Gone. 

When Sony give you your case number they also give you a link to track your return. That evening, just because I'm bored I type in 666X666 and my postcode. 

[In transit to us.]

Cool. 

I then check Royal Mail tracking who confirmed the same.

What follows is a breakdown of what happend next.

11th [In transit to us]
13th [In transit to us]
14th [You do not have access to view this page] 

I figured that was an error but I was away for a couple of days so wasn't spending hours on the phone sorting it out. Fired them a quick email anyway. 

Royal Mail told me it was delivered to the distribution centre but that's as far as their tracking goes because Sony then use a different service.

16th [You do not have access to view this page]

I had no choice but to call the number I got from Twitter.

Gave them all my details. Explained I'd been locked out of tracking to be told they'd received my unit on the 11th. So the tracking was wrong anyway. It was now at the repair centre and would be back with me in 14 - 21 days. Even though the website says 15 max. Okay fine. Doesn't bother me. I work a lot anyway.

17th June 2022 I received an email asking me to rate the service I'd received and informing me my PS5 was yet to be received but they'd keep in touch. I was confused. The person on the phone said they'd received it at the repair centre on the 11th. Now 6 days later they don't have it? 

Obviously I call them again to be told I don't exist. Not my tracking number. Me. They've no record of ever speaking to me via the phone or emails. Luckily I screen capped the emails which I promptly sent over.

18th June I get two emails telling me;

*Your PS5 has been received and the repairs team are working on it. 

*Your PS5 is still in transit to the repair centre.

I can't call them because the call centre is closed Sat and Sun - so I send back a very polite email explaining I will call them first thing Monday the 20th June and I want to know WTF is happening.

20th June and I give them a ring. I'm INSTANTLY put through to a manager. They don't even ask. They just tell me they're doing it as soon as I say who I am.

I explain that I'm fine with it taking 14 - 21 days - it doesn't bother me. I just want proper confirmation they have it as so far I've been told it's not there, it is there, I don't exist... etc

The manager tells me the following... 

""We recieved the console this morning at the distribution centre. It will be sent to the repairs centre today and you will have it back by the 28th June.""

Awesome. I thank him, hang up the phone and go about my day. 

1656 on the same day I receive an email...

""We are pleased we could assist you and are now closing your case.""

Closing the case? You've still got my console. I think not.

I try to call but they close at 1700 apparently. 

21st June 2022 I'm straight on the phone. 

The woman tells me that I received my console at 1029 that morning (yesterday). ""The f*** I have...""

She goes off to get a manager who spends the next twenty minutes calling me a liar and saying they have a signature, proof of delivery, etc etc 

I ask them to forward me an email containing all of this information and tell them I will be in London that afternoon, at their office to show them my security footage from my house.

Suddenly the manager says...

""Oh. Sorry. Your console will be there today between 1330 and 1530"".

I'm still angry from being called a liar and say;

""I still want the proof of delivery you have from 1029 this morning though. Ya know. My signature. A photo. Whatever it was you have there in front of you...""

He hung up.

1525 Brand new, replacement PS5 - in a brown box (no PS5 box) turns up and I don't even have to sign for it because the DPD drivers machine isn't working.

I genuinely believe that they knew the firmware messed it up, they had it on the 11th, they then lost it between the 12th and 14th and thought I wouldn't check - locking me out of tracking intentionally, didn't want to repair it and finally I think if I hadn't have caused such a fuss I believe they would still be maintaining I'd got it back even when I hadn't.

PS5,Has Sony stated how often they plan to add to the games catalogue to the new PS+?  I know that the game Stray will be added to the service on July 19th but I can't find anything about regular updates.  Will it be a monthly update of a few games like Gamepass on XBox or will it basically be whenever they feel like it with how Nintendo does it with NSO?  I managed to get the Premium upgrade for free for the next year so am just wondering if it will be worth it to have a continuous subscription or just subscribe whenever they update the games.,How often will the new PS+ be updated with games?

PS5,"so as we all know, sony released the new ps plus tiers recently. and as we also know, the classics catalog is extremely barebones, which is disappointing. the ps2 catalog literally has only 4 games in it, and those are the jak and daxter games. ok sweet, those are some cool classics, and one of sony's most beloved mascot platformers. so with the lack of other ps2 games on the catalog, you'd think that sony would have done everything to make sure that these games are delivered to us in the most utmost condition right? WRONG! 

for those of you who decide to start paying 120 bucks per year, you need to know that this game cannot be platinumed for a large quantity of players, on both ps4 and ps5. trophies come with all 4 jak games, so they're clearly an advertised feature of the new ps plus service. well, this is just to let you know that many players out there, including myself, cannot get the platinum trophy because the game is glitched. 

if you attempt to platinum the game, you need to obtain all 600 precursor orbs, the primary collectible in the game, and ofc this has a couple trophies tied to it. problem is that gaining all of these is impossible for some people. there are numerous side challenges in the game that do not award their orbs upon completion. I finished doing the wasteland run race today, and despite beating the gold medal requirement, I wasnt awarded with any trophies for the challenge. i've tried replaying it numerous times, to no avail. and this isn't the only challenge that awards orbs either. im currently at 576/200 orbs and im a hundred percent positive that i've done everything that im supposed to do for all the other orbs. i've found all the collectible ones via youtube guides, and i've gotten all the orbs related to the various in-game mini games. but it would seem that some challenges do not properly give you the orbs, most notably the races. my high score tab in the pause menu has shown me clearing every single gold medal time for every challenge, and yet im still short on 24 orbs. for some people it might be slightly less, and for some slightly more. nobody knows what the issue is for sure because neither sony nor naughty dog have ever fixed this issue.

the game is currently running on version 1.02, and it doesnt appear to be possible to delete the game and attempt to play it on version 1.00, since you need to be connected to the internet to redownload the game, and doing so prompts you to download the most recent update as well, which presumably broke progression. it was originally released in 2017 as part of the jak and daxter bundle, and even now in 2022 this has not been fixed. for those who bought it digitally, this was already insulting, but the fact that sony chose to voluntarily put these games onto their new premium service which they're charging people for, just for them to find out that they cant obtain the platinum either, is a whole new level of disrespectful. you'd think that with the ps2 catalog being as pathetic as it is, they would have done everything in their power to polish these emulated games as much as possible. there have been numerous other threads made on reddit regarding this issue, but nothing was ever done. 

my hope is that this post can bring some awareness to this issue and get sony to release a new update for it, since they're essentially charging for an advertised feature that doesnt work properly for a lot of people. there are NO missable collectibles in jak 3, but some of them definitely are glitched, and need to be fixed ASAP, because this reflects poorly on sony.",PSA for PS premium subscribers: jak 3 is (technically) broken

PS5,"Hello everyone, I have a little problem that haunted me even when I was playing on my PS4. The left thumb stick started drifting around 2 weeks ago and I know way too well that's it's going to become worse. I am not looking for solutions, I tried resetting it and all and I'm not going to unscrew everything in order to fix it because I still have the warranty.

Since I have the warranty there shouldn't be a problem but the store I bought the console will ask me to send the PS5 too. I do find to be an annoying process and I would prefere to send only the controller.

My plan is to buy a controller from the same store and switch the controllers but I don't know if there is any way for anyone to see if I switched them or not.",Is there a way to tell if a controller was sold with the console or separately

PS5,"We are 20 months into the console generation and the biggest ""innovation"" that came with PS5's new UI, the activity cards, are still wasted potential.

They seemed like such a cool feature pre-launch. Jumping in your save file right from the home screen rather than having to go through the game's main menu? Yes please!
Offering tips and tricks for when you get stuck or want to unlock a trophy? Awesome.
And so much more...

But let's be real, who actually uses them?

I think there are two main issues that need to be fixed ASAP:

1. Visibility: when you press the home button mid game the activity cards will immediatly pop up. That's great. But how about when you view the game from the home screen? E.g. in order to select the activity card that boots you right into your most recent save file. Well, you actually have to press downwards twice on the controller. That's terrible. You won't even be seeing the avtivity cards unless you actively seek them out. So I personally forget to use them most of the time eventhough I could boot into the game much faster.

2. Consistency: there is zero consistency between games. Is there an activity card for loading my most recent save? Are there activity cards with tips and tricks? How do these activity cards look like? I simply don't know. Because of that I can never build muscle memory like ""pressing down and square will always launch the activity card that boots my most recent save"". Instead I always have to search for the card I'm looking for... if it even exists that is.

Possible solution: Sony need to make a few mandates that all new games will have to follow. The most important one in my opinion is that there has to be a Resume activity card that boots you right into your save file. This card also has to be the first card you see when selecting a game from the home screen. Secondly Sony need to rework their UI to make it more easy to understand at a glance what an activity card does and they need to make it easier to view and select an activity card from the home screen. They should probably go even further and include a hotkey that will immediatly load your save file. E.g. loading your most recent save directly from the home screen by pressing the square button.

What are your thoughts?",Activity Cards are still poorly implemented.

PS5," Salve. I am a Latin student and I have been studying all Elden Ring choral songs.

The first one I analysed was 'song of lament, not a boss theme, (aka song of the bats) whose lyrics are indeed in Latin. I contacted the lyricist who wrote them 3 months ago and then (for my surprise) I was told that only those were written by that person. Then I published those Latin lyrics and their translation at the time (Games from Mars channel got them from me and thus fairly credited me in his video) and I was looking forward to finding another Latin song in Elden Ring. 

For that purpose,  I contacted some music producers who worked in Elden Ring and they confirmed that 99% of the lyrics in the game are not in any language at all and don't mean anything. 

I have recently published some of my conversations with them on r/eldenringdiscussion by the way.

The Elden Ring music producers explained that the lyrics were computer generated and adjusted to sound like ancient languages.

 In order to help my research on the use of random syllables to simulate ancient languages in game songs, I was given the official lyrics and I have been analysing them carefully. Check out Mohg's official lyrics for example:   [https://youtu.be/fgM8HZRRvoI](https://youtu.be/fgM8HZRRvoI)  

As you could see, some times the lyrics resemble Latin, but they are not in Latin. The goal was to simulate ancient languages songs to enhance the dramatic feel of the player's experience.

I know it may be frustrating to know about it, but I was told that process is quite common in video games actually.

Sadly a wave of fake news last week about 'translations' of Elden Ring Bosses song lyrics spread pretty fast. I talked to youtuber Vaati and (fortunately) he is aware those are fake translations. So be careful, let your ears know 99% of Elden Ring song lyrics are computer generated syllables created to simulate ancient languages songs.

Cheers,

Magister Organi

I tried to make sure the stand was as flush and secure against my system before i tightened the base screw. I have noticed though, that if you look really low from the front, there is a gap between the console and the stand, and quite a bit of the screw is visible.

Can anyone else please confirm if theirs is the same way and that this is normal? Sorry for worrying, i will feel much better if it is just how it is supposed to be.

Thanks folks! I hope everyone is doing well and having fun with their systems!",Visible screw when using the PS5 base vertically?

PS5,"Yesterday afternoon my PS5 was unplugged while in rest mode(just a mistake from the power strip, wasn't downloading or playing anything just charging a controller) and after I turned it back on I did the normal repair, restarted and everything was fine. I've noticed no issues in any games, but I was playing Ghost this afternoon and I'm seeing a weird visual bug. When moonlight/light is hitting the bamboo it creates this weird white outline on the trees. It only is showing at certain angles but still a concern I don't remember seeing it before and hoping it has nothing to do with the console not being shut off properly.

The new PS+ dropped and I paid the extra conversion fee in order to see whether or not I liked the service before committing to paying 120 dollars a year.

I cannot return it because Microsoft considerers it a ""Deal""/""Package"" with the series X that I bought at the same time. If I want to return the controller, I have to return the console as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am good at repairing things, so is it worth taking apart to repair it? Are there any warranties that I am voiding by doing so?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just frustrated that I spent $180 on a controller and I would rather use the amazing controller that came with the series X over the Elite 2.

XboxSeriesX,"Good day, gamers.

I have been googling for a whole day looking for an answer, hoping I wouldn't have to make a post to ask.

I was interested in buying a gaming headset that works on all my consoles, Xbox, PS5 and Switch (Corsair Virtuoso XT) and it says it connects to Series X via 3.5mm in the controller.  Can I get Atmos surround sound this way?  I've seen some people say you can and some say you cannot get surround sound using 3.5mm, that with 3.5mm, you will only get stereo sound.

If the Virtuoso is not what I should shoot for, is there any other headset that I can get surround with all my consoles?  Or is the only way to get Atmos and surround on Xbox is to buy a headset made specifically for Xbox?

Thank you in advance","Dolby Atmos with headphones, how?"

My $3,800 gaming PC (had it for 1/12 years) literally just failed on me. Its broken. No way of me fixing it, nor is there any warranty from the company.  So I've accepted it that's pretty much 4K down the drain.

Anyways. My point is... That console is so much better than PC's, yes PC can get you better graphics / performance and other amazing benefits but having to worry all the time about whether the PC is going to break anytime soon or come a couple years time and it's time to upgrade your CPU / graphic cards for so much money it's ridiculous. Whereas with Consoles you're set for a good 8-10 years and with the direction that consoles are going, I wouldn't be surprised if we overtake PC ( impossible I know but who knows lol)

(1) What do you think, should send back my controller or learn to deal with high deazones?
(2) To elite series 2 owners: What deadzone do you have to use, to neutralize stick drift?",Elite Series 2 acceptable deadzone

XboxSeriesX,"Full disclosure here, I own both a PS5 and Series X, and I actually got my Series X first yet I play it way less than my PS5. We're talking MAYBE 4 months worth of actual gameplay on the Series X.

Right out of the box I remember the Xbox controller feeling like a cheap, plastic piece of crap. It honestly felt *worse* to hold and use than the controller that came with the Xbox One. Anyone agree?

So after the 4 months worth of usage on the controller I'm ALREADY having problems. For one, whenever I navigate menus, especially the Xbox home screen menu, if I just push the left stick (or even press the d-pad once) it will RAPIDLY skip over menu options. Like if I'm looking at my games library and push down on left stick real quick, one time, you'd think it would go down just once, right? Nah. It jumps like 3 times. Not sure if this is a controller issue or just the Xbox being stupid. Neither would surprise me.

The second, and bigger issue, is RANDOM right stick drift. And when I say random I do mean random. I mean, some days I'll go to play and the issue won't be there at all. Everything will be fine. Then the next day I'll go to play and no matter what game I play as soon as I take my thumb off the right stick it drifts upwards, causing characters in games to just, you know, LOOK UP. 

WHY is this happening? How is this happening? Is it software or hardware related? Is the Xbox really THIS big of a POS that the controller is failing after 4 months of casual gameplay? And no, I don't throw my controllers or anything. It may have dropped from my chair like once or twice. You know, shit happens. But *that* shouldn't cripple a controller.

In comparison, the PS5 controller (that I've played WAY more on) is still fine. And we're talking about a controller that allows games to set pressure sensitivity in the triggers and sometimes you just squeeze those bitches so hard in the middle of a game you feel like you're break them. But nope, still fine. Hell, while we're on the subject I also have an Oculus 2 and I've dropped those controllers a ton of times. I remember slamming the right one in to a wall once on accident. Hurt my hand and put an indent in the drywall, but the controller was perfectly fine.

I shouldn't be having any issues with a $500 console that I rarely play this early on.

Is anyone else experiencing something similar with their controllers? Is there a way to fix it, or does it sound like my controller is just screwed and now I need to drop $60 on a new one?",Why is the Series X/S controller so crappy?

I'll notice, even on games I've played and beaten some user reviews major complaints about a game will be due to bugs or saying the game feels unfinished.  I Personally never ran into any bugs worth mentioning in some of the games others are giving one star due to their buggy experience.  Now I do not and never have played on PC so this just as thought I had and I'm curious if maybe it could be a lackluster PC they're using? Can something like a terribly optimized PC cause the bugs or if it is the game the poor PC just makes them more noticeable?

XboxSeriesX,"I feel like this game could greatly benefit from being on Game Pass. I tried it out this past year and was totally lost to everything in the game, it‚Äôs kind of overwhelming going on. But this past week I decided to rent it from Game Fly again, and I have a buddy who‚Äôs been showing me the ropes. It‚Äôs so much more enjoyable when you take the time to learn it and have people helping you out. 

The basis of the game is you‚Äôre a monster/bounty hunter. You can go into a match solo, duo, or trios. And the goal is to find the monster lair clues, track it down, and kill it. When you kill it, you have to take the bounty token to extraction and make it out alive. All the while there are enemy player hunters doing the same thing. And I can‚Äôt express how intense the engagements can get. It‚Äôs some of the most satisfying pvp fights I‚Äôve ever been in. Imagine being in or around the boss room, and you hear a pack of crows go off bc another set of players spooked them. Or a pack of dogs start barking, and you know another team is closing in. Now you gotta decide to go fight the boss or handle the enemy team coming in. What if you do kill the boss? Do you high tail it to extraction or duke it out with the other hunters? It‚Äôs really intense! 

The problem with the game is you can literally go down in like 2 bullets. The game is hella unforgiving and makes it tough for new players to come in and learn unless you have someone helping you. I was fortunate to have a friend who plays teach me, but it‚Äôs really not as complicated as you may expect. 

Something I found was confusing at first was the in game economy and guns and hunters situation. You really don‚Äôt have to spend a penny on the game. Everything you can buy with real money is purely cosmetic. But if you want a cool looking variant of a gun or a cool looking hunter you can spend a couple of bucks on the game. 

I feel like this game has a solid player base. I have no issues getting games. But I feel like this is a good game to be on game pass. Even if it was free to play, I could see it still doing good and being in the same league as Apex, and all the other battle royal kinda like games. I mean this game is PVE/PVP, but. 

The game is currently on sale for $10 on the Xbox Store. If you‚Äôre looking for a good pvp with really intense firefights, and some good pve monster and boss fights, pick it up. It‚Äôs so good! I‚Äôm glad I gave it another chance. I just feel like people are scared to go in on it bc of how unforgiving it can be, and it‚Äôs not free to play like other games of its kind.","Hunt Showdown is currently on sale for $10, and I feel like it deserves a higher praise and attention. It would be a great addition to game pass."

I thought maybe it was just the games themselves. my friends want me to play destiny 2 with them here and there and that game sucks, so I figured the constant crashing was just the game because sense when has destiny ever worked as intended. but through out the months ive owned it more and more games just started crashing. 


borderlands, warframe, aliens fireteam, back for blood, castle crashers, devil may cry, cyberpunk, and probably others that I cant think of. but just now I was playing halo 3 on mcc and my game froze mid turn then hard crashed. then I logged back on and got banned. so that's awesome. has this been a problem for other people as well? I know they've had alot of issues making them consistently when it launched and still do so I didn't expect to go without some problems. but I figured this would be fixed with updates overtime. now I think I just have a faulty console. that would explain why i also haven't been able to update the store for like 5 months either. it always has to update then it hits 99% and never finishes. but is this a common issue that can be fixed myself? or is this something Microsoft has to fix?",so many games just freeze or crash.

XboxSeriesX,"Not much time left due to a medical condition and would like to enjoy some time.

My friends true colors have shown once I shared the news.

So I‚Äôm just looking for people that would be playing around these times. Figured asking 33 million on Reddit is faster than an Xbox post a day to maybe 50 people about 1 game. 

Sure I can meet randoms again and make another group. But finding 4 people to play at a certain time that are all open to different games would be very difficult. Then to find a shit load of people to play any game i choose would be even harder and it would take up TIME I do NOT have. I‚Äôve done that over the years and I‚Äôve gotten 2 solid groups but then someone moves, gets married, etc.

I finally feel good after all my workouts between 9pm central time to whenever.  I would Like to go to bed at 1-2 to repeat my process but if I‚Äôm enjoying a good time I‚Äôm staying up to enjoy that.

I have any system and will play almost any game. Games the group Of 4 of us had played the last 2 years before we slowly lost members would of been,
Apex, rainbow, PUBG, battlefront 2, aliens, dwarf miner game with creatures, fortnite, sniper 5, TMNT, gt5, GT7, fall guys, far cry, red dead online, tarkov, Warcraft. I‚Äôll play anytibg from indie to AAA. 

If someone just wants to stream and chat. Where I don‚Äôt even play I just watch and tlak while i do my workouts. As it gives me motivation to push through that pain. 
Sure I can watch YouTubers but when it‚Äôs less people and you can personally talk to them it‚Äôs different.

XboxSeriesX,"So I‚Äôm on a COD kick right now, I‚Äôm trying to complete as much as I can on each of the titles. There‚Äôs been an ongoing trend of - for example, I need to pick up 46 pieces of intel, I pick up all of them but the game only registered 45, so normally I just go delete all the save data a restart the game fresh, the work around seems to be that once you pick up the 1st intel on the fresh game start, it‚Äôs counts towards the 46th, and unlocks the achievement. 

So I‚Äôve put down as much COD MW3 as I could before I noticed things were not registering, literally nothing is registering, from the collection type challenges to the challenges like shooting down a certain amount of helicopters with a grenade launcher. 

I went through every step possible, I swear every combination of suggestions‚Ä¶

Completely deleted the save data using the 360 interface.

Completely deleting from the Series X interface.

Deleting the reserved space.

Deleting the local 360 storage.

Deleting the local saved games.

I uninstalled  the game and reinstalled it.

I have tried going offline.

I‚Äôve tried a hard reset.

I‚Äôve tried all of the above in different combinations.

I‚Äôve tried all of the steps that I can find or think of, however, when I‚Äôm hopeful that the game will load up a fresh new start, like it‚Äôs the 1st time it‚Äôs ever been fired up, there it is ‚Ä¶. 100% on the single player campaign, all of my collectibles are accounted for and no achievements are working.

I played COD MW Remastered, I had similar issues, but was able to delete the files from ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù and start a fresh game, then I played MW2 Remastered, same issues, again I was able to delete files and start fresh. Keeping in mind COD MW 1 &amp; 2 Remastered were made with the newer consoles in mind, now COD MW3 is a physical 360 disc, I wonder if it has to do with actual 360 games vs. newer titles?

So I‚Äôm at a lose, I‚Äôm kind of bummed that I can‚Äôt progress any further on anymore challenges or achievements. 

I‚Äôm hopeful that someone might have a solution to my issue if I explained it enough to make sense. And I read the rules of the sub Reddit,  I hope the doesn‚Äôt fall under the ‚Äúno tech or support post‚Äù rule, if it does I apologize, please suggest a more appropriate sub Reddit.

XboxSeriesX,"So, I‚Äôm very lucky to have got a Series X last year, so I‚Äôve been playing that pretty exclusively.

I‚Äôm now setting up my study now we‚Äôve moved into a new house, the Series X is staying downstairs in the lounge, but the study is going to be a room where I can play Xbox if the wife (who‚Äôs a avid gamer like me) or kids are playing a game downstairs, or vice versa. The room will have a fairly basic 43in TV in there, so graphical performance isn‚Äôt top tier. 

So I was thinking about putting my old XB1S to use. I have a few options so wanted some opinions. 

Do I‚Ä¶..

A) Upgrade the One S with a new fan as the old one is high pitched with age, replace the HDD with a SSD, not so much for speed but because the old drive is becoming louder and louder. This would be the only Xbox in that room.

B) Get a Series S, and sell/donate the One S.

C) Get a Series S and just replace the fan of the One S, using that for physical games/movies that I can‚Äôt play on Series S, while using the Series S for digital games or games that can effectively use the extra power. 

Really I can see both sides of the fence, and since this is a opportunity to use a space for work and for gaming, I think it‚Äôs well worth using it. What do you think?",Is it worth putting my old Xbox to work?

I personally wish they would reactivate LIVE on the 360 again and put most older games for the SX in the MS store or in gamepass and people with a SX or 360 collectors are both able to play online again. This would boost sales both in the MS store and gamepass and a profit for developers.

Nintendo always makes fun takes on real life sports (Olympics, tennis, golf, football etc) and have seen success.

Game Pass is the perfect delivery vehicle, but the game could be a ¬£20-30 budget title.

It has the Gears of War IP associated with it, which can aid marketing.

It gives The Coalition and/or a secondary studio to play around with Unreal 5 without making a full blown game. Think about when Rockstar made Table Tennis.

This game could be a fun one off, that Gears fans may enjoy, but also can go incredibly silly and act as a game to introduce daft crossovers like including Master Chief, Banjo and other silliness.",Xbox/The Coalition should make an actual Thrashball game.

And rightly so. The art style, the music, the characters, the platforming. Everything feels so tight and polished.

The article does mention this: 

‚ÄúThe new deal between Rare and Microsoft will yield five games over the next two years and included among those will be Kameo, Perfect Dark 2 and games from the racing, platformer and shooting categories.‚Äú

So maybe MS acquired Rare simply to make more console exclusives or is there perhaps more to this story and how seemingly Rare never really lived up to the standards that MS might have been hoping for since Rare hasn‚Äôt made that many good games after this acquisition happened.

Order was expected to be delivered next day, by Sunday the shipment is marked as lost by Amazon Logistics as it is being shipped directly by Amazon. Well, fast forward to today after it was rescheduled and the order was cancelled.

I called customer service and they were able to get me a quick refund but the issue is, I now have no way of getting the console without another invitation and who knows how long that will take?

First, my controller came faulty the right trigger felt a bit weird and after a week or so starting sticking. So I sent that back and got a replacement under the warranty at no cost to me.

Secondly, my Xbox stopped reading discs. Turns out it was a common problem with the new console and so I had to send that back. Bear in mind it‚Äôs not an easy thing to package the console without the original box especially as you don‚Äôt want it damaged during transit, I had to buy a box big enough for it and bubble wrap. So I sent that back and got a replacement as it was still under warranty.

Lastly, the controller that I had replaced originally the right bumper broke so the controller is basically unusable for gaming. It‚Äôs not under warranty anymore so I‚Äôm going to have to pay for a replacement.

I‚Äôve only ever had Xbox consoles and I have never had a problem with any of the previous, the fact I‚Äôve had so many problems with this generation within the first 18 months is seriously disappointing.",Disappointing experience with Xbox Series X. Wasn‚Äôt expecting hardware issues.

XboxSeriesX,"So around midnight last night I was unable to connect to any of my games, not even youtube would work on the Xbox. 

I've tried resetting my router. I've tried doing a factory reset (with and without games still downloaded) I've done a hard shutoff and unplugged the Xbox for 5 minutes. I've cleared the MAC address, I've tried switching NAT ports. I've tried just about everything under the sun that was recommended and nothing is working.

Wifi still works for my phone and other devices connected to it. It's only the multi-player games I try to queue into that don't work. I have Skyrim AE that worked just fine when downloading mods to it. 

There's no update available for the Xbox either so it can't be that. It just seems to be going back and forth on whether the issue is caused by my internet or the Xbox and idk what else to do at this point.

If anyone has had a similar experience and has had it resolved I would be very grateful to you. I don't get the chance to game much with how much I work and it's my only escape hobby at the moment so not being able to squad up with my friends really fucking sucks.",Can't connect to any game servers

## Critic Reviews

[**Checkpoint Gaming**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/563/checkpoint-gaming) \- [Victor Tan](https://opencritic.com/critic/9220/victor-tan) \- [8 / 10](https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2022/07/as-dusk-falls-review-a-serious-look-at-consequences)

&gt;As Dusk Falls tells a wonderful story that is not only thought provoking, but willing to discuss difficult subjects that aren‚Äôt often talked about. With every decision having an impact and putting the focus on characters, the story themes are effectively communicated and make you interested in seeing what happens next. Experiencing the game with your friends is also enjoyable, fostering discussions of your choices and what kind of decisions you make. While getting 100% completion for the game can be a tough journey, you are rewarded with story details that open up character motivations and keep you thinking about the characters long after you put down the game.

&gt;As Dusk Falls is a stellar first attempt from Interior Night and a must-play for those who enjoy interactive narrative games like The Quarry, Heavy Rain, and Detroit: Become Human. In many ways, the game feels like a playable season of Fargo and even channels other gritty crime dramas like Breaking Bad at times. Essentially, it's a playable binge drama, but one that can be enjoyed time and time again, with different endings and twists, depending on your choices.  
&gt;  
&gt;As Dusk Falls will make you hurt, and it will make you cry, but it won't let you down.

&gt;As Dusk Falls is an atypical narrative adventure game with a compelling story about family.

[**EGM**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/38/egm) \- [Michael Goroff](https://opencritic.com/critic/4103/michael-goroff) \- [4 / 5 ](https://egmnow.com/as-dusk-falls-review/)

&gt;As Dusk Falls is exciting,  beautiful, and heavy-handed. Its more streamlined approach to narrative gameplay and its less traditional art style create an immersive experience that engages with the player's imagination. That it can work both as a morally challenging single-player story and a party game for multiple players speaks to the confidence that its developers have. But its second half of the story undercuts some of the tension that its excellent first half builds, and a terrible cliffhanger might leave you feeling betrayed.

&gt;An interactive movie that tells a memorable story of human choices.

&gt;So overall, is As Dusk Falls worth it? It has a captivating story with more than a few rocky moments, but is as close to feeling ‚Äúgenre‚Äù as it can get. It also has a lot of shortcomings that might only be saved by the interesting multiplayer features. It‚Äôs the perfect game to pull out for any digital or physical get-togethers, but is otherwise a reminder of wasted potential.

&gt;We have a lot of gripes about As Dusk Falls, but we‚Äôve still very much enjoyed our time with it. Its story will keep you hooked from start to finish, but some of its narrative gaps will leave you with questions. Should that keep you from playing? No ‚Äì ultimately, this is a very well-executed narrative drama complete with excellent voice acting and a unique art style. Yes, it could have been better in many ways, but it‚Äôs still worthy of your time.

&gt;Due to its strong script and pitch-perfect performances, Interior Night's debut stands among the very best games of its kind.

[**GamesBeat**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/78/gamesbeat) \- [Dean Takahashi](https://opencritic.com/critic/1046/dean-takahashi) \- [3 / 5 ](https://venturebeat.com/2022/07/18/as-dusk-falls-review-the-line-between-drama-and-soap-opera/)

&gt;As Dusk Falls is a valiant attempt to tell a good crime drama where actions have consequences. The story went on a lot longer than I expected, as the tense moments at the motel spawned a lot of different threads ‚Äî both flash forwards and flashbacks ‚Äî that I didn‚Äôt expect. But ultimately the tale failed to move me in the way that I had hoped for.

&gt;As Dusk Falls tackles intimate themes with intimate storytelling. It spends meaningful time with believable characters and complex personal issues. It attempts to explore answers to those relatable and sometimes unanswerable questions about ourselves. And most importantly, it doesn‚Äôt get distracted or lost along the way.

&gt;As Dusk Falls blends Netflix-style prestige drama with Telltale-style game storytelling to great results

&gt;As Dusk Falls offers a great new take on the adventure genre, focusing on a story that feels grounded in the real world, made all the more impactful through its stellar artwork. The multiplayer works fine and is fun, but I found myself wanting to play without others. Satisfying narratively regardless of your choices, As Dusk Falls is weighty and serious, surprising with great writing, realistic characters, and plenty of twists. Highly recommended.

&gt;Without digging too deeply into the real reasons behind Interior Night's choice of aesthetic and presentation, As Dusk Falls is one of those cases of a solid foundation let down one too many times by its execution.

&gt;As Dusk Falls' interactive crime drama is a masterwork of branching storytelling where decisions matter and repeated playthroughs are rewarded with even more revelations.

&gt;As Dusk Falls is a perfect video game to play in company regardless of the experience of the people involved in the game, a well-written and remarkably resolved decisional adventure that delivers an interesting story, and will guarantee you a couple of nights of good entertainment.

&gt;As Dusk Falls tells a compelling story and offers an excellent gameplay experience. The game tries to fill a significant market gap because the demand for interactive visual novels is relatively high. But teams capable of creating a good story adventure are scarce. Nevertheless, we are delighted that INT./NIGHT studio has tried to do it. The gameplay brings nothing new to the table, but it still manages to tell a competitive story that you'll be thinking about for days after you finish it.

&gt;As Dusk Falls delivered an enthralling narrative with solid characters to follow. The game‚Äôs original graphics and art direction were off-putting at first but grew on me over time. The soundtrack and voice acting were both excellent. Multiplayer was well realized and added a whole new dimension to the gameplay. Though the game‚Äôs ending was a huge letdown and felt cheap overall. Despite this, As Dusk Falls is a solid experience and is worthy of your time.

&gt;A tense and dramatic interactive movie with superbly realised characters, a breathless plot, and a still-frame animation style that's likely to prove extremely divisive.

&gt;As Dusk Falls is an adult, dramatic adventure with unusual artistic choices, yet functional to an ever engaging narrative. Almost similar to an interactive TV series, it will keep you glued to the screen until the end, eager to discover the fate of the many realistically and often starkly delineated characters, but also to explore the many ramifications of the story. The excellent acting, moreover, succeeds in making the most of such a production. Too bad for a few technical issues lightly impacting the enjoyment of the game, but it is definitely a highly recommended experience for lovers of narrative adventures and TV crime dramas.

&gt;Xbox Game Studios' branching crime drama is best enjoyed in a group, with friends arguing over decisions and taking the blame for fatal outcomes

&gt;As it ran its course, I realised I quite adored As Dusk Falls. As a decades-spanning crime thriller throughout America's western plains, it's well acted and admirably realised. Although the cliffhanger beckons another chapter, my journey through As Dusk Falls felt whole, though I can't wait to explore all of the possibilities on offer.

&gt;As Dusk Falls is an interactive drama that places you at the centre of an incredibly tense robbery gone wrong. Aside from some rare wooden dialogue, it's a touching tale of loss, betrayal, fear, and love that I hoped wouldn't end.

[**Seasoned Gaming**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming) \- [Ainsley Bowden](https://opencritic.com/critic/3283/ainsley-bowden) \- [8 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2022/07/18/review-as-dusk-falls-actions-and-consequences/)

&gt;I truly enjoyed my time with As Dusk Falls. As a form of interactive entertainment, it is well-written, well-produced, and engaging.

&gt;As Dusk Falls is an impressive debut from INTERIOR/NIGHT. It tells an emotionally impactful story with some solid vocal performances. The branching storyline is cleverly implemented and the multiplayer features offer a convenient way to play with friends. As Dusk Falls is a clear indicator that the future is bright for INTERIOR/NIGHT.

&gt;As Dusk Falls is a tense and exciting drama about crime and the families who get involved in it. If you love crime-drama TV shows, then you'll feel right at home with this game. This storytelling video game feels intense and interesting at every turn. However, you should be aware of its shortcomings and limitations before purchasing.

&gt;As Dusk Falls is undoubtedly a better written game than all the others created by Quantic Dream. with beautiful and complex characters and a compelling and mature story.

&gt;As Dusk Falls is the non-game narrative adventure for your non-gaming family and housemates. It‚Äôs the most engaged I‚Äôve ever seen my lapsed casual gamer partner in a videogame and that‚Äôs because it has the familiar story pacing of a six-part TV series and almost no gameplay, which means minimal barrier to entry.

[**TheSixthAxis**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis) \- [Nick Petrasiti](https://opencritic.com/critic/5526/nick-petrasiti) \- [9 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?p=399109)

&gt;As Dusk Falls caught me by surprise, taking a genre of game that's become a bit too familiar and injecting it with a tense crime drama and a singular flair. My hat goes off to Interior/Night and I'm really looking forward to seeing what they do next.

[**TrueAchievements**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/316/trueachievements) \- [Sean Carey](https://opencritic.com/critic/3367/sean-carey) \- [8 / 10](http://www.trueachievements.com/n50411/as-dusk-falls-review-spoiler-free)

&gt;For the most part, As Dusk Falls excels as an 'interactive drama.' With wonderfully crafted and relatable characters, superb voice acting, and unique art direction and animation style that lends itself to the story. The first few chapters alone are excellent, and they‚Äôll have you gripping onto your controller when things are tense and utterly deflated when you‚Äôre forced into making a tough decision. The game is only let down by a weaker second act and a rushed final chapter, but overall, it‚Äôs still a great narrative adventure filled with dramatic moments, tension, and tough choices.

[**Twinfinite**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/21/twinfinite) \- [Chris Jecks](https://opencritic.com/critic/92/chris-jecks) \- [3 / 5](https://twinfinite.net/2022/07/as-dusk-falls-review/)

&gt;I‚Äôd gone in hoping for a groundbreaking style of narrative-driven experience, one that operated on a sprawling web of branching paths over the course of 30 years of events, and was left underwhelmed by a fairly by-the-numbers entry in the genre that only dips its toe into its three decades-of family history and character entanglement. If you‚Äôre a fan of the genre, you‚Äôll probably have some fun with this, but it‚Äôs hardly the revelation that the decision-based, narrative-driven genre feels like it so desperately needs.

[**VGC**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/821/vgc) \- [Jordan Middler](https://opencritic.com/critic/8444/jordan-middler) \- [2 / 5 ](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/as-dusk-falls/)

&gt;Good characters, strong performances and well-engineered dual timeline storytelling are let down by pacing that‚Äôs utterly arhythmic and gameplay that‚Äôs fighting you at every step.

[**WellPlayed**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/382/wellplayed) \- [Kieran Stockton](https://opencritic.com/critic/2453/kieran-stockton) \- [8 / 10](https://www.well-played.com.au/as-dusk-falls-review/)

&gt;This interactive crime drama packs a unique visual style and some gripping moments dealing with mature themes. The choices you make are crucial to the fates of two families, but the impact is more keenly felt in the first act than the second.

[**XboxEra**](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera) \- [Jon Clarke](https://opencritic.com/critic/7203/jon-clarke) \- [7.5 / 10](https://xboxera.com/2022/07/18/review-as-dusk-falls/)

&gt;As a big fan of cinema and storytelling, I enjoyed the attempt at a mostly well told, if somewhat predictable yarn, full of plot twists and surprises, particularly with friends in tow.

If I try to invite him into a just a party, he never gets the invite either, and when he tries to be the host, he doesn't even see me as a friend. The gaming TV uses the next gen version of the game, and he's of course on the One version.

XboxSeriesX,"Make sure you set the Arctis 7X to default flat in Steelseries GG. On Xbox, go into Dolby Atmos, set Surround Sound virtualizer on (optional - I like the extra reverb and echoes!), Volume Leveler off (hurts dynamic range I'm thinking). Then for sliders, adjust as follows:

32hz: +4dB

64hz: -2dB

125hz: -4dB

250hz: -3dB

500hz: 0dB

1khz: +1dB

2khz: +1dB

4khz: +1dB

8khz: -5dB

16khz: +1dB

I am using the Brainwavz leather earpads with cooling gel, so I get better bass response. Highly recommend these! And of course, this is what my ears like the most. I followed the frequency response curve that RTINGs provided in their review in order to adjust the frequencies for accurate, reference sound! You may like a bit more bass, that's fine. Don't increase the 125hz band too much though! It may muddy the sound in games and music... also, if you find the highs too crispy and painful, you can always tone down the 2khz or 4khz band! Idk how the highs would sound with the stock earpads using this EQ. So you can always leave them at default if you are worried about ear fatigue. As for the 16khz band, I like a bit of airiness, but I'm still unsure where to set that specifically lol. If you have any ideas or suggestions of what you'd change, feel free to lemme know what you think! I'm a big fan of these headphones for games and music, and I hope this helps somewhere out there who couldn't stand the out of box sound :)",Arctis 7X Headset - Best EQ for Accuracy using Dolby Atmos!

XboxSeriesX,"It is infuriating to have a game left in an unplayable state.  The most egregious offender at the moment for me is Civilization VI (with DLC).  Trying to play multiplayer with a friend results in multiple crashes every few turns.  Single player is just as bad.  Now I have a base game and multiple expansions that are unplayable.

Microsoft probably receives a crash report (or should) when a game errors out.  They should have a method in place to evaluate the number of crashes and, if it exceeds some percentage based on the active players, freeze purchases of the game or DLC in the Microsoft store until the publisher addresses the issue.  Maybe this would motivate lazy publishers to fix their games.",Idea: Microsoft should freeze the sale of games that consistently crash.

XboxSeriesX,"My launch controller had a fatal stick drift error. By fatal I mean it was registering full tilt in one direction. It was unusable. Ended up selling it on Ebay for scrap and using the proceeds towards a design lab controller. Within a year (and of course past the 6 months warranty) both bumpers stopped working. Disassembled the controller and found that both stems on the bumper snapped clean off. 

This is from normal casual gameplay. The game was extremely bumper heavy (Watchdogs Legion). Yesterday, the left bumper stopped clicking. I'm not hard on controllers and I'm not a super hardcore gamer anymore, but I'm noticing a trend since the Xbox One generation where I went through controllers like candy. For the $60-$70 they ask for these controllers, the build quality is garbage. Especially the Design Lab stuff. I can understand controllers wearing down over the course of 3-4 years, but less than a year is utterly ridiculous. 

I remember PC accessories from ten years ago that still work. Joysticks, flight sticks, racing wheels, etc.  I spent good money on them and they lasted for years. If I could spend a couple hundred on an Xbox controller that was built like a tank and lasted me 10 years, I'd do it. But it seems that even the Elite controllers are garbage build quality.

The margins on these controllers have to be ridiculous because the build quality is cheap. Looking at this broken bumper in my hands, it didn't stand a chance. Looks like a cheap 3D printed part.

Microsoft either needs to improve the build quality of their controllers by using better materials for the sticks, bumpers and buttons or build a modular controller with parts that are easy to swap out when they wear out. But I don't think Microsoft cares. When I suck it up and drop $70 - $100 on a new controller, they just laugh all the way to the bank.

Thankfully, the bumpers are readily available on Amazon and easy to replace. But right now, I'm stuck holding my dick while the replacement comes in.",Xbox One/Series X Controllers Are Terrible Build Quality - Repairing my Second Controller Already This Generation

XboxSeriesX,"Want to be clear here - am really, really not looking for console wars stuff here. At all. I love my PS5 and I greatly enjoyed my 360.

Now that's out of the way! I was lucky enough to get a PS5 at launch via a Sony invitation, and I indeed love it. That said, I was a dual Xbox-PS owner up until the XB1; I was able to buy launch versions of the original's adorable giant black and green box and then the launch 360 with its 20 GB hard drive (lol), followed by the 360 slim. Can't really remember why I never went for the XB1 but I can only surmise that I didn't think it had enough console exclusives or otherwise differentiated itself for me. I don't play FPS so, while I've always enjoyed Halo's single-player campaigns, it's not really a killer app for me.

That said, there's a lot of old games on the 360 that I've wanted to play for a long time (my 360 wore out many years ago after a series of moves). Additionally, it looks like 9th generation consoles might be going back to the sorts of exclusivity agreements that were very common in the 6th and 7th generations.

So, other than Microsoft exclusives (I do kinda wanna try Flight Simulator...) and access to my old 360 library, what might I gain by having both consoles? What differences exist out there other than the physical size of that enormous black mini-fridge, XB Game Pass, and Halo? Are there any other plusses that I might not be aware of? It's my understanding that there's also some nifty integration with Windows PC games but I'm visually impaired and have used Macs for the last 20 years so that doesn't really do anything for me.

Again, to be clear, this is \*not\* in order to replace my PS5, but instead to sit alongside it (probably literally). At this point I'm leaning heavily in favor of trying to get one sometime this year but would definitely love some input. Thanks!",Thoughts on Series X for a happy PS5 owner?

XboxSeriesX,"I am looking for multiplayer games with progression which were released after 2017, meaning relatively new. 

What I'm not looking for are games that are like rocket league or COD games where you go into a match which lasts for a 10-15 min and after each match someone wins and someone looses. 

I'm looking for something like GTA online. It has progression as in, you do missions/quests and not only are you upgrading your skills, but also in the other aspects of gameplay. 

I know I'm unable to articulate my idea extremely well, though I hope I'm being understood. 

Please avoid sinple player games.

Looking forward to your recommendations.","Multiplayer Games With Progression, 2017 Onwards"

XboxSeriesX,"I apologise in advance for yet another post about storage, I have tried in vain to find the answers I‚Äôm looking for and am an absolute noob when it comes to understanding technology, so here goes‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm thinking of getting a Seagate Expansion Card so I can play XSX games from the storage, and an external SSD for the ‚Äòextra‚Äô storage on top, instead of getting the 2TB expansion card - is this the best of both worlds in terms of value for money?

Firstly, SSD‚Äôs vs HDD‚Äôs - Do they need their own dedicated power supply or do they receive everything needed via the USB?

Are there different types, does it make a difference/is there a noticeable benefit from one over the other? I‚Äôm thinking SSD for the obvious benefit in processing speed but does that alone justify the cost? 

Do they have specific hardware requirements such as USB speed etc? Again, any difference? Xbox says it needs to be USB 3.0, anything other that that?

SSD or HDD? Does it really matter if I‚Äôm getting a Seagate Expansion Card too?

Does connecting an external SSD/HDD and an expansion card cause any additional load on the Xbox like air con would on a car engine? If so is this healthy, can the Xbox handle it all at once?

Do I need to leave my Xbox is ‚ÄòInstant On‚Äô mode or can I continue to use energy saver as I usually do?

How do I go about formatting them for use with a Series X? Can this be done from the console or do I need a PC first?

Thanks for reading of you get this far and for any advice, it‚Äôs very much appreciated!

# Senate leader Schumer met with Microsoft President Brad Smith to discuss tech antitrust bills

 

 

Senate Majority Leader [Chuck Schumer](https://www.fedscoop.com/tag/chuck-schumer/), D-NY., met with Microsoft President [Brad Smith](https://www.fedscoop.com/tag/brad-smith/) last week while visiting Washington state and discussed bipartisan tech antitrust legislation that Schumer is expected to bring up for a vote later this summer.

&amp;#x200B;

The top Democrat, who is in charge of the Senate‚Äôs agenda, discussed policy with Smith including two bills that are making their way through Congress right now related to increasing Big Tech competition, the journalism industry, and data privacy, four sources familiar with the meeting told *FedScoop*.

If they become law, the bills discussed during the meeting could force [Microsoft](https://www.fedscoop.com/tag/microsoft/) and other big tech vendors to change how they operate in consumer and federal markets.

In particular, Senate bills [S.2992](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2992) and [S.2710](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2710) would restrict the collection and use of internal vendor data and place restrictions on Big Tech companies related to installing and uninstalling software on their products.

Schumer was [spotted](https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/schumers-visit-to-seattle/) in Bellevue, Washington last week and is expected to have traveled to the state to meet with tech executives like Smith and for fundraising purposes.

Liberal advocacy groups have recently called on Schumer to [disclose any ‚Äúdark money‚Äù](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2022-07-13-senate-majority-leader-chuck-schumer-disclose-dark-money-donations-from-big-tech) or hidden funds that he and other Democrats have received from Big Tech companies like Microsoft in order to remove the appearance of any conflict of interest.

The [American Innovation and Choice Online Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2992) (S.2992), would prevent tech giants like Amazon from unduly favoring their own products on their websites or creating cheaper copycats of existing products using internal data.

Meanwhile, the [Open App Markets Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2710) (S.2710) would regulate the management of Apple, Google and potentially Microsoft‚Äôs app stores, which advocates say would enable greater competition on the platforms.

These are the two most significant antitrust bills that Schumer supports, and which the Senate majority leader is [expected to bring up](https://www.axios.com/2022/05/19/scoop-schumer-seeks-tech-antitrust-bill-vote-by-early-summer) for a vote later this summer. The bills, which have bipartisan backing, are expected to have enough support pass within Congress and become law if they are bought up for a vote.

The legislation could make it more challenging for Microsoft to bundle its software programs like Microsoft Office, Microsoft Teams, One Drive cloud services and others that it sells together or pre-installs to customers in consumer and federal markets. This could give rivals to Microsoft Teams like Zoom and Slack more of a chance to compete for consumers and federal contracts.

Smith has been unclear and noncommittal regarding Microsoft‚Äôs stance on the AICOA, [telling Geekwire](https://www.geekwire.com/2022/interview-microsofts-president-on-turbulent-times-for-the-company-country-and-world/) in June that ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not trying to lobby in favor of the bill. But that doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre opposing it either.‚Äù

The bill provides a big boost to tech critics and anti-monopolists by creating new rules of the road for Big Tech platforms such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.

‚ÄúIf Microsoft is being wishy washy about the bill, it probably means they‚Äôre opposed to it for some reason or the other,‚Äù a source familiar with the meeting said.

Microsoft has avoided much of the [antitrust scrutiny](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/microsofts-antitrust/619599/) from Congress, federal agencies, and the public in the past two years while supporting some of the antitrust bills that would hurt Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google which has [angered](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-has-evaded-the-antitrust-scrutiny-of-its-rivals-playing-the-white-knight-11624897722) Microsoft‚Äôs fellow tech giants.

Some Republicans, like Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary committee which regulates the tech industry, have even called for Microsoft to face the [same antitrust scrutiny](https://republicans-judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/JDJ-to-Microsoft-6.21.2020.pdf) as other large tech platforms.

Sen. Schumer and Smith also discussed the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at helping the news industry get better compensation for content posted on Big Tech platforms such as Google and Facebook, which Microsoft‚Äôs web portal and search engine compete with.

The two leaders also had conversations about online data privacy and regulations around it. Many tech giants have come under fire for their [controversial data-gathering](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hidden-ways-big-tech-sucks-up-data) and usage practices that often secretly infringe on users‚Äô privacy.

Democrats and Republicans favor establishing a national privacy standard to hold Big Tech companies more accountable for how they gather and use the data they collect but there is no consensus on how to do this within a comprehensive piece of legislation.

Microsoft‚Äôs pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard and related investments and jobs that could be created within the Capitol Region of New York was also discussed during the meeting, two people said. Schumer also [pushed](https://www.timesunion.com/business/article/Schumer-urges-Microsoft-to-invest-in-Capital-16923948.php) Microsoft to invest more in the video game industry of the region when he met with Smith in February of this year.",Senate leader Schumer met with Microsoft President Brad Smith to discuss tech antitrust bills

XboxSeriesX,"For those games that have the option anyway. How do you play?

I never minded subtitles, and usually I liked going with whatever the default was for a particular game. But lately, I've been turning them on whenever I can.

I've found that the audio mix for dialogue in a lot of games (even AAA ones) can often become muddled or just drowned out by ambient noise or music, to the point where I miss a lot of what's being said.

It's not a speaker issue. I've calibrated and blanaced my speakers, and movies and TV shows all sound great and crystal clear. This seems to be a game-specific issue.

In a way it sucks because sometimes subtitles can ruin the immersion of a game, but if I don't turn them on, I can only guess at what's happening in the story.

It's ironic because I imagine the sound engineers on these games spend a shit load of time perfecting their mixes. And when it comes to creating a mood, surrounding you with wind or gunfire or ocean waves or whatever the game is about, they usually nail it. (Horror game mixes especially creep the fuck out of me in the best way! A perfect example is the monotone chanting of the Hiss-possessed employees of the Bureau in Control.)

I can't tell you just how excited I was to see how fast and how gorgeous my old games might run on this beefy machine. My first disappointment was that you have to download all the games to the hard drive from the internet and not form the disk in order to play. Which is fine, probably runs faster not having to access the disk for any of the games data, so whatever I got over it. BUT, my second disappointment was that half of my collection is unavailable, straight up will not let you play them even though I own the physical disk... (One of these days I'll post my collection that Xbox decided I'm no longer allowed to play) BUT even worse is that a few (I haven't checked all of them) are available to purchase from the Microsoft store! Notably Marvel vs Capcom 3... My final frustration is that the remote play is incredible, being a father of two the portable gaming is SO convenient for me, however YOU CANNOT REMOTE PLAY ORIGINAL 360 GAMES??????????

This is more than frustrating, it's straight up upsetting, part of me wanted to take the system back which isn't fair. The series X is truly an incredible device, and it chews through old games without busting a sweat. Go back and play games like red dead and just be amazed that the load times are virtually non existent which only adds to the immersion of it all. 

In short I feel like they have imposed needless handicaps on this machine that makes me want to cry. Literally tears in my eyes typing all this...

Everything was 100 Mbps at least except the Xbox which was coming in at around 30-40mpbs. Fast forward and after an hour of messing with all the network settings under the sun with Microsoft support and no results, tried switching ports on the modem, adding port filtering to the router to try and speed it up to no avail. 

This led me to see if others were having the same issue and I came across dozens of similar post's to mine, where people have 900mbps and they can only pull about 100-130mbps. I couldn't find any other threads recently and the ones i found were from 1-2 yrs ago but no definitive answers or help were given. 

The weirdest part is how when i pulled the Cat7 and ran it on WIFI, it got FASTER (50-60mbps), so i was like maybe its just the cable, tried a cat5 cable and still the same at 30-40mpbs. 

Please help me yall, I am open to cracking the console open and cleaning her cause she's dusty but that might not do anything. also forgot to mention that for the first year I had my Xbox I never had any issues with getting my full network speed. 

TL/DR: Wifi somehow faster than ethernet and max speeds aren't even 50% of what I pay, support and forums have no answer.",Ethernet Slower than WIFI?

XboxSeriesX,"Hello everyone,  
   
I would like to share my **ULTIMATE set of Optimized Settings for all LG 2017-2022 OLEDs and Xbox One/Series X|S , PC, PS4/PS5 and Switch gaming**, with the best PQ and lowest Input-Lag results possible (from 4ms to 21ms based on model) and **also including Dolby Vision and webOS in-built Apps settings for Movies and TV Shows**.

 

These settings are the results of 5+ years of gathering professional calibration results (using external equipment and software), valuable online knowledge from the most reliable sources and direct testing &amp; analysis.  
   
Yeah, I know, ""settings _cannot be copy/pasted from TV to TV as they're all different_"" , but tested LG OLED variance between models is much lower then average, and even within a 3% variance you will still experience a much more accurate image compared to default presets, plus CMS and WB advanced options weren't touched in order to avoid variance error as much as possible.  
   
There are **6 Profiles to independently 1-time-Setup for each source/content combination**, and then forget about it.  
   
In order to do it, just change the video source to the one you want to calibrate (for example: webOS Netflix app, or to HDMI1 connected to Xbox Series X / PS5) and then load up the type of video content you want to calibrate (for example: launch an SDR Game, or an HDR Game, or a Dolby Vision movie).  
   
Once you're ready, **apply the Optimized Settings specifically for your LG OLED Series** (see the sections below to identify your TV settings):  
   
   
**Recommended Settings for LG 2017 OLED Series only:**

- [**Xbox One/Series X|S, PC &amp; PS4/PS5 + SDR Suggested Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KHY0Y-5dzfkMj8Xl2XrnOgqSX6FFp04IDd5gv_F699Y/edit?usp=sharing) - _Note_: try to launch any SDR content to start calibrating, for example just stay in the Dashboard Home. All Xbox SDR contents will share the calibration;  
 
- [**Xbox One/Series X|S, PC &amp; PS4/PS5 + HDR Suggested Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j1ArpZ_OOJP2K3oeogB7eou7NRPJlKLxpEc6kI5Yguk/edit) - _Note_: Try to launch any HDR content to start calibrating, for example just open ""Insects"" Demo or any other HDR game. All Xbox HDR contents will share the calibration;  
 
- [**Xbox One/Series X|S, PC + Dolby Vision Suggested Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D62pGcvPfOQN3mh_j11PYwh1thF-JPOu5cHlB9tVzdI/edit?usp=sharing) - _Note_: try to launch any Dolby Vision content to start calibrating, for example just open Netflix app and launch a DV movie. All Xbox Dolby Vision contents will share the calibration;  
 
- [**webOS + SDR Suggested Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvUD2Tue-GyQJuCpW3pPAOTZ-YlHhqHKTjf4ri1Ngw4/edit?usp=sharing) - _Note_: try to launch any SDR content to start calibrating, for example just open Netflix app from your LG remote. All webOS SDR contents will share the calibration (with the exception of TV Channels and Media app, which will also be separate);  
 
- [**webOS + HDR Suggested Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J7Ov1kKmrA-Z_oyX5Gj4O-YzI_75tboxrKbRNoFOxYM/edit?usp=sharing) - _Note_: try to launch any HDR content to start calibrating, for example just open YouTube app from your LG remote, and search for any HDR videos. All webOS HDR contents will share the calibration (with the exception of TV Channels and Media app, which will also be separate);  
 
- [**webOS + Dolby Vision Suggested Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dKwavl6b5eHh9ylQFKBQLD08rhQNcDMEiWnM4J3x6hw/edit?usp=sharing) - _Note_: try to launch any Dolby Vision content to start calibrating, for example open Netflix app from your LG remote, and start playing ""Altered Carbon"" show. All webOS Dolby Vision contents will share the calibration (with the exception of TV Channels and Media app, which will also be separate).

  

These settings are tailor made and compatible with ALL 2017 LG OLEDs variants (e.g. LG B7, C7, E7, G7, W7).

For newer Series' settings, read below.  
   
   
   
**Recommended Settings for LG 2018 OLED Series only:** 
   
Use the same settings for 2017 series above, then apply the following changes:

- SDR Game and SDR ISF Dark presets: bring back Tint to 0;
- HDR Game: set Color value back from 60 to 55; set Dynamic Contrast: OFF; set Dynamic Tone Mapping: ON;
- Dolby Vision: change OLED Light value from 50 to 100.

  
   
   
**Recommended Settings from LG 2019 to 2022 OLED Series:**

**If you have a 2019-2022 LG OLED apply the following changes first, then proceed with the updated Overall Settings Chart below:**  
 

- Use ""PC"" HDMI Icon for your HDMI devices in order to unlock 4:4:4 Chroma Subsampling for both SDR and HDR ([Read more](https://www.resetera.com/threads/lg-2017-2022-oleds-optimized-settings-for-xbox-one-series-x-s-ps4-ps5-and-webos-movies-sdr-hdr-dv.73304/post-87028631));

**Xbox HDR Calibration Setup for 2017 HDR Game Mode (Option 1b) or 2017-2022 HDR Game Mode when using DTM (no HGIG):**

- First screen / Min. Luminance: 0 clicks (all the way to the left)
- Second screen / Max Luminance: +54 clicks (starting from 0)
- Third screen / Max Luminance: +54 clicks (starting from 0)

**Xbox HDR Calibration Setup for 2019-2022 HDR Game Mode when using HGIG:**

- First screen / Min. Luminance: 0 clicks (all the way to the left)
- Second screen / Max Luminance: +10 clicks (starting from 0)
- Third screen / Max Luminance: +10 clicks (starting from 0)

&gt; To verify you've correctly calibrated HDR on Xbox HDR Calibration Setup: 

Press LT + LB + RT + RB at the same time. Then check in the upper right corner ;)  
 (It should be: 0, 4.000, 4.000 for Option 1b/DTM | 0, 800, 800 for HGIG or 0, 1.000, 1.000 for LG G2)  
   
   
**PS5 HDR Calibration Setup for 2017 HDR Game Mode (Option 1b) or 2017-2022 HDR Game Mode when using DTM (no HGIG):**

- First screen / Max Luminance: +25 clicks (starting from 0)
- Second screen / Max Luminance: +25 clicks (starting from 0)
- Third screen / Min. Luminance: 0 clicks (all the way to the bottom)

**PS5 HDR Calibration Setup for 2019-2022 HDR Game Mode when using HGIG:**

- First screen / Max Luminance: +14 clicks (starting from 0)
- Second screen / Max Luminance: +14 clicks (starting from 0)
- Third screen / Min. Luminance: 0 clicks (all the way to the bottom)

  
   
   
Let me know what you think.  
   
Hope you enjoy it :)  
   
Cheers,  
-P  
 

  
   
**NOTE:** Don't forget to adjust HDR ""Sliders"" also in game settings if available. Usually, for these TVs, you need to ""increase"" the level of Max HDR Brightness ""Slider"" to make the game logo/icon totally disappear in a white background, or set it to a numerical number around **4.000 nits (for Option 1b or DTM: On/Off)** or **800 nits (for HGIG)**. 

**Dolby Vision games** on Xbox + C8/C9/CX/C1/C2 should be set **at 1.200 nits** (while **for B7/C7 should be set at 10.000 nits!**), but **it is not recommended to game in DV** (see below the Insight about it). 

**Paper White** could be set around **200 nits** in all cases. 


This is the reason why, even with both the console and the TVs properly calibrated, some games may look ""dark"" or ""washed out"" if these settings are left to default.

Once you're ready,¬†**apply the Optimized Settings specifically for your LG OLED Series**¬†(see the sections below to identify your TV settings):  
¬†  
¬†  
**Recommended Settings for LG 2017 OLED Series only:**

- [**Xbox One/Series X|S, PC &amp; PS4/PS5 + SDR Suggested Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KHY0Y-5dzfkMj8Xl2XrnOgqSX6FFp04IDd5gv_F699Y/edit?usp=sharing) -¬†_Note_: try to launch any SDR content to start calibrating, for example just stay in the Dashboard Home. All Xbox SDR contents will share the calibration;  
¬†
- [**Xbox One/Series X|S, PC &amp; PS4/PS5 + HDR Suggested Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j1ArpZ_OOJP2K3oeogB7eou7NRPJlKLxpEc6kI5Yguk/edit) -¬†_Note_: Try to launch any HDR content to start calibrating, for example just open ""Insects"" Demo or any other HDR game.

All webOS SDR contents will share the calibration (with the exception of TV Channels and Media app, which will also be separate);  
¬†
- [**webOS + HDR Suggested Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J7Ov1kKmrA-Z_oyX5Gj4O-YzI_75tboxrKbRNoFOxYM/edit?usp=sharing)¬†-¬†_Note_: try to launch any HDR content to start calibrating, for example just open YouTube app from your LG remote, and search for any HDR videos.

&gt; To verify you've correctly calibrated HDR on Xbox HDR Calibration Setup:¬†

Press LT + LB + RT + RB at the same time. Then check in the upper right corner ;)  
¬†(It should be: 0, 4.000, 4.000 for Option 1b/DTM | 0, 800, 800 for HGIG or 0, 1.000, 1.000 for LG G2)

Hope you enjoy it :)  
¬†  
Cheers,

¬†

  
¬†  
**NOTE:** Don't forget to adjust HDR ""Sliders"" also in game settings if available. Usually, for these TVs, you need to ""increase"" the level of Max HDR Brightness ""Slider"" to make the game logo/icon totally disappear in a white background, or set it to a numerical number around¬†**4.000 nits¬†(for Option 1b or DTM: On/Off)**¬†or¬†**800 nits¬†(for HGIG)**.¬†

**Dolby Vision games**¬†on Xbox + C8/C9/CX/C1/C2 should be set¬†**at¬†1.200 nits**¬†(while¬†**for B7/C7 should be set at¬†10.000 nits!**), but¬†**it is not recommended to game in DV**¬†(see below the Insight about it). 

**Paper White** could be set around **200 nits** in all cases. 


This is the reason why, even with both the console and the TVs properly calibrated, some games may look ""dark"" or ""washed out"" if these settings are left to default.

Also when the battery dies it logs me out, I guess? For example, when ur picking sides in whatever game and u are under the ‚Äúred‚Äù profile. When I turn the controller back on, it will automatically change to the ‚Äúblue‚Äù profile which doesnt seem to have any vibration.

I thinking of moving onto a RTX 3080 rig with the provision to swap to a 4000 series GPU next year.

Apart from the ‚Äòpick up and play‚Äô aspect of the console, has anyone swapped or currently use both? Wondering what your pros/cons are?

I figure with a 3080 and DLSS I‚Äôm generally going to get better graphics than the Series X (especially once I move to a 4000 card). I‚Äôm more than happy to stick to 60fps too. Ray tracing will be better. Higher quality settings.

I figure once game pass gets more to my liking and more first party games come out I want to play, I can just get game pass for PC. 

My Elite 2 or DualSense will both work with PC (I much prefer controllers) and I have an LG CX which should work really well for PC gaming.

XboxSeriesX,"Hey guys! On the July 7th, 2022, I bought a used Xbox series X off of someone for $200. The seller stated that it had an issue with the HDMI port and it was loose. I take it back home that same day and disassemble the Xbox. When I finally get to the motherboard I see the HDMI connector had fallen completely off and inspecting the connector I see that at least 10 pads were ripped off from the traces of the motherboard. I was going to attempt to start repairing the Xbox myself but I decided to throw a Hail Mary and contact Microsoft Support to see if maybe they could/would repair the device.

I was originally told by the Representative that they wouldn‚Äôt repair it due to its 1yr warranty being expired, but apparently one of the previous owners sent the Xbox in for a repair, so it still had a few months of extended repair warranty, I‚Äôm guessing. 
The sticker on the back of the console states Service Date: March 18, 2022

They emailed me a shipping label (free shipping from So Cal) and I sent the Xbox in for repair to El Paso, Texas on the 8th. Late night on the 12th, I get an email from Microsoft stating that it had arrived at their service center and that they have started processing the Xbox. This morning the 14th, I received an email with a tracking number stating that they are shipping the device to me, however, neither the email nor the Microsoft website show whether the device was repaired, replaced with refurbished unit, or if they denied the repair and are sending the unit back to me as is.

I contacted Microsoft Support through phone call to see if they can give me more insight as to whether the device was repaired replaced or being sent as is. The representative stated that they have basically the same info as I do, just showing the status tracker but not being able to see whether device was being repaired or replaced, I would just have to basically wait until I receive the device

When checking the FedEx shipping tracker, It shows that the unit is being shipped from El Paso, Texas and I would receive it Monday the 18th. When looking at previous Reddit post from 1yr ago I see that replacement refurbished/new units were shipped to owners from Kentucky. So I‚Äôm assuming that a device (either the same one or a different unit) is being shipped to me from the same facility.

My question to anyone knowledgeable about this Microsoft‚Äôs repair process or to anyone that has sent in a Xbox for repair recently:

What do you think?

What‚Äôs the possibility that the device was repaired and being sent back to me?

Do you think they just sent me a replacement, even though it‚Äôs shipped from Texas instead Kentucky?

Or do you think they denied the repair and sent me back the device as is without repairs being made?

XboxSeriesX,"Hey guys. I know it's prob been asked before but I just wanted to confirm my setup is ok. I have normally purchased LG tv's in the past but this time I decided  to go with the the Samsung Qn90a over the CX or C1. The Samsung is on sale for 400 off too. The only downside is the Samsung has one 2.1 port and a separate port for earc that's a 2.0. No biggie since I only have a Series X right now that I'll need for the 2.1. Now I know I'll be missing Dolby vision and multiple 2.1 ports by not getting a LG C model but something just told me to run with Samsung this time as I also didn't notice any big difference from HDR10 over Dolby on my last LG B Tb btw. 

Here's  where I want to confirm that I'm ok still though. I have a HW-Q80R Dolby Atmos Soundbar that does require Earc for true Dolby. The soundbar itself also has an earc port. So, do I simply connect my series X to the HDMI 2.1, the soundbar to the earc port and I'll be all good to get the full benefits of true Dolby sound on the Xbox where and get my 4k 120hz on xbox? I guess if I ever get other devices that require the 4k 120hz I could buy a 2.1 switch too so I don't have to manually switch HDMI cables.

TLDR
Will my Qn90a be setup correct if I put the series X into the HDMI 2.1 and my earc Dolby Atmos soundbar into the 2.0 earc port and I'l be ok this way and won't  lose any functionality? I assume my apps on the tv will also work in proper Dolby sound off the tv etc? From all that I've read this seems to be correct but just want to confirm. Otherwise hell i could akwats return and buy a C1.",Connecting Series X to Samsung QN90A

XboxSeriesX,"So, I started with an original PS when they came out. I went to PS2, then bought a 360 and fell in love with XBOX.
I went on to get the Xbox One and ended up selling it for the PS4.
Then. Two weeks or so ago, I walked into my local BestBuy and they had a few PS5's.... like,  just randomly. 
So yeah,  I bought one.
Then two days ago, I go in there again,  and see they have a bunch of Series-X's, so I was like screw it! 
So now,  I have both.  I really like having game pass ultimate, that's worth the price of admission alone!

XboxSeriesX,"The title says it all, I've seen people saying you don't need one, but I did run into an issue with just a PC wanting to play games with friends. PUBG for example doesn't do crossplay, and I have some friends that play that non-stop. Apex is frustrating because they won't transfer accounts from different systems but I could live with that. Just looking to see what the general consensus is, I'm thinking of selling it again but I don't really need to.

XboxSeriesX,"I don't think I'm unique in that, from time to time, I hit a bit of a gaming slump, like I'm in right now. Nothing is keeping my attention. I'm not interested in sitting through a complicated story that comes with most of the bigger open-world games, largely because when I have the time to play (work, wife, and kids eat a lot of time) I don't want to sit through a lot of exposition. I feel like I've played all the good indies. Rogue-likes are always a favorite because they are perfect for my schedule but I've played all the good ones of those too (Hades, Dead Cells, Binding of Isaac, ect), even some of the lesser known ones like Undermine. I'd love something in the Tunic or Death's Door style but nothing seems as good or polished as those (I'd love just a new tLoZ).

The only game recently that really grabbed me was the Steam demo for Cult of the Lamb, which I'm super pumped for. It feels insane that with everything on Gamepass and the store, nothing feels like what I'm looking for.  I'm probably going to take a step back from games for a bit, but I'm curious if anyone else has gone through this and found a game that just pulled them back in.","What were your ""slump buster"" games?"

Now for the Xbox One X, I tried to install a disk version of GTA V. The Xbox One version not expanded and enhanced obviously. It was going fine until it got stuck at 16.1%. I took out the disk, cleaned it, and it didn‚Äôt budge. I cancelled the installation and it made it‚Äôs way back to 16.1% but now, it shuts down and takes my TV with it just like the Series X.

I work a job with alot of free time, especially on night shifts and I can just bring a controller with me and crush games on my phone now!

XboxSeriesX,"So I have a turtle beach stealth 700 gen 2 rn and it‚Äôs starting to fall apart. First, the voice chat wheel is broken and only increases which makes the chat way too loud. Second, the headset is breaking in the inside. Whenever I put the headset on, there‚Äôs always something rattling inside and it makes me nervous of what it is. Third, the connection issues are horrible. When I connect the headset it sometimes just disconnects after three seconds. The headset doesn‚Äôt turn off, the Bluetooth still works, but it disconnects with the Xbox and its a pain to turn off and back on again (which the ON and OFF button sometimes doesn‚Äôt work too). Finally, the mic is horrendous. My friends always complain about my mic being really sensitive and I can agree. The mic can pick up even the smallest of sounds, which isn‚Äôt always a good thing. I had this headset since Christmas of 2020 and as you can see it didn‚Äôt last me a long time. I took really good care of the headset and never ever put aggressive force into it.

So I‚Äôm looking for a new headset, one including Bluetooth and a really good mic. I was looking into the steelseries Arctis 9x and the official Microsoft Xbox headset, but I get mix opinions on both of these headsets. Some people say the Xbox headset is the best and the mic is amazing and other people say it is really bad and cheap. Same with the arctic 9x. To me, a great mic is a key importance to me, especially playing in the same room with someone else and doesn‚Äôt take in too much noise. So what headset should I dig deeper into? steelseries? The official Microsoft headset? Maybe even the new turtle beach stealth 700 gen 2 MAX? Or another headset I didn‚Äôt mention? (PS: I‚Äôm really sorry if this is too much to read. I just wanted to rant about my headset and talk about what I‚Äôm looking for in a new headset)!",Headset recommendations

PS5 is my main system, I‚Äôll be buying most games on that. Really just thinking about getting back into the Xbox scape for gamepass and the occasional exclusive they catches my eye like Starfield. I see a lot about how the S isn‚Äôt very future proof, but will it be future proof enough to play games like Starfield at an acceptable level? For the much cheaper price compared to the Series X and what I‚Äôll be using it for, I‚Äôm feeling the Series S will be ideal for me. I‚Äôm just worried/wondering about the whole future proof thing, I understand it isn‚Äôt as powerful as the X but that isn‚Äôt really a big deal to me as I already have a PS5, but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to buy a system that will be obsolete and can hardly play truly next gen games at all in the next couple years.

\- the stadiums look pretty nice, but I just saw someone in the public clapping their hands inside a chairs 

\- variety of shots is good, but dropshot is not that fine/smooth to do

\- commentator is useless and does not add much. Also, when someone is serving at 5-5 and had a game point for 6-5, the commentator always says it's match point. When the players wins the game and it is 6-5, he says ""the game is done"" wtf 

\- also, why the referee does not say the players name? Like, ""advantage Medvedev"" or ""game Medvedev"". Quite boring.

\- no ball boys. Even if they do not move, at least put them there

\- hawkeye would be a good addition, to make the game more realistic 

\- the animation between games/services suck. Either the player (that is now serving) is asking for balls, and then making the gesture that it is receiving the ball + bouncing it without the actual ball being there, or the camera focus a player that just won the serve, and now is ready to receive while the line judge is still making the sign the last ball, from 1second ago, was out

XboxSeriesX,"Hey all. 

I‚Äôm playing on an LG C1 @4k/120hz/VRR on. 

My dashboard does not transition smoothly up and down.  It‚Äôs choppy and acts like it‚Äôs transitioning at a low FPS.  

If I open a game and then minimize the game by pressing the home button, then it‚Äôs suddenly the dashboard works butter smooth. 

It also runs smooth if I go lower than 4k, or if I run it at 60hz.

I‚Äôve tried clearing my cache, deleting save game data, full shutdown/restart.  None of that seems to change anything. 


Is this normal behavior when running at 4k/120?  Seems pretty abysmal If so.  

It‚Äôs almost like the Xbox drops it‚Äôs power state to 10% or something low when idle in the dashboard.  I can understand the logic but not at the cost of visual fidelity‚Ä¶seems like MS should at least have a minimum power state that doesn‚Äôt sacrifice dashboard performance. 


Or - worse yet, there‚Äôs a hardware problem with my unit. 


Anyone else have this issue?",Dashboard choppy/not smooth
XboxSeriesX,"Console started to freeze and hard shut down while making a buzzing noise.  It was fine until yesterday, but it has shut down 4 times by itself and the last time was after about 10 minutes. The light on the controller starts to blink and i have to remove the battery pack to turn it off. Mind you, i did all of the troubleshooting things for this kind of problem personally but to no avail. It has crashed on every game ive tried to play. At first, despite it being warm but not hit while playing Scarlet Nexus i thought maybe it overheated somehow. It was about half the temp of my old base PS4 after some sessions,  so i didnt think nothing of it and moved the console to a more open area on my stand while switching to laying it horizontally to no avail. 



So, im sending it in through Microsoft to get it repaired tomorrow for free.  Theres no physical damage, so i will make it a point to take pictures of the console entirely in case there is any confusion.


My thing is.....since im getting it expedited tomorrow how long will it take? The site says like 6 days but i got my Series X through Microsoft in 2 days when they site said it would take about a week. Im just curious.


Also, since i bought it directly through Microsoft will i be getting a new Series X or a refurbished one if they think my console  isnt worth saving?


If they do send refurbished, what is the quality like with it? Is it similar to how Gamestop refurbishes systems?

Things I've tried...
- Different HDMI ports
- Different Ultra High Speed HDMI Cables (original Xbox cable and highly rated new one)
- Resetting the Xbox to factory settings
- Resetting the TV

Some have reported that it's overcome by changing to 60Hz/turning off VRR but that's pretty ridiculous for such a pricey TV.

XboxSeriesX,"Ever since the debut trailer I've been excited about this game. We had a verified user named Sponger on ResetEra with a big list back then of allegedly planned feature. Bigger and more dense than Skyrim was one, boss fights planned, lots of towns and cities and so on. With more than two years of absolute radio silence on the game any bit of info is welcome, even if it's not official. But Jez often is a good source.

I was on XboxEra and someone has listened to the latest podcast with Jez and I have the links to the comments of the user.

https://forum.xboxera.com/t/xbox-game-studios-ot9-how-many-games-would-a-game-studio-make-if-a-game-studio-could-make-games/11550/5620?u=staffy

So basically it's on the scope and scale of The Outer Worlds and not Skyrim. It's more like AA than AAA. With no official info at all I think it's probably not a bad idea to maybe set expectations a little lower, well, I'm talking about myself here. It would really surprise me if it's on the same scope as TOW, that was a game on a lower budget, they have Xbox budgets now and seemingly has been in development for much longer too AND has a larger team as well.

Jez last year already said the gameplay he had seen was way different than the debut trailer which was dark and moody while what he saw was more colourful. It seems the bit at the end of the trailer wasn't gameplay after all, probably. But either way, I can't deny I'd find it very disappointing if it's ""only"" on the scale of TOW. I probably should not have hyped myself up so much with unconfirmed information by Sponger.","After what Jez said about Avowed, I'm gonna set my expectations accordingly"

XboxSeriesX,"This is my first post here and let me get straight to the topic.

Basically I already own a PS5, a Switch and a gaming laptop (Ryzen 7 + RTX 3060) and I'm itching to buy a Series X. Pretty sure is just my slightly not diagnosed shopping addiction, and I'm trying to convice myself I don't need it. Money is not really a problem, but can't figure out if it will just be a glorified paperweight or if I'm going to actually get something out of it. 

So I just want to have the opinion of people that are in similar situations, and if the Series X was a good buy or not.

My main reasons to buy it are backwards compatibility (sad that it doesn't run Alpha Protocol, but it's the only classic game that I want to play that it doesn't run). Also, I know many games I can play them on PC, but the simplicity of just downloading a game and play it without having to solve Windows issues is just amazing.

So my idea would be:
* PS5 - exclusives and games not on GamePass
* Xbox Series X - exclusives and GamePass
* Switch - exclusives and game that are better to have on a portable format (Stardew Valley for example)
* PC - mainly PC genres games like strategy and competitive online

So yeah, I know I'm fortunate to have this problem, but what I need to know is **Do I really need a Series X or am I just overthinking?**",Do I really need a Series X?

Now that I have a house I obviously have a game room. I love collecting physical and I have other current consoles (PS4 Pro and Switch), but I just wish the 10000 game minimum for Xbox wasn't a thing. Apparently to put out a physical copy on an Xbox platform the developer/publisher has to make a minimum of 10000 copies to sell. Apparently that's why Limited run/super rare never have Xbox editions of their games.

 All these new horror games that are out, or coming out are not physical on Xbox:

-Tormented Souls,
-Oxide Room 104
-Madison
-Martha is Dead
-Song of Horror


I'm sure there are more.... It's frustrating. So what would you all suggest? Should I just suck it up and by on switch or PS4 Pro. Sometimes these games come out down the line for Xbox as well which is also frustrating like The Medium, Blair Witch, and observer. (All bloober games which is weird).

XboxSeriesX,"I remember in the months leading up to the XSX release Microsoft were touting both FPS boost and Resolution Boost. The resolution boost is obviously the less impactful of the two but still, I was hoping to see either some more 360 games or (preferably) Xbox One games get a boost. Some are in dire need of it, like Dead Rising 3 at 720p or Ryse at 900p. Even just a doubling of those resolutions would bring them up to a much clearer 1440p/1800p. 

But considering the radio silence and how Microsoft ended FPS boost and backwards compatibility, I think it‚Äôs safe to say that resolution boost has probably been put to bed as we slowly end the cross-Gen period. Less and less people clamoring for it as the true next gen titles start hitting. 

I would still love to see it though. Even if it‚Äôs just on a handful of games. Truthfully I‚Äôd like to see whatever method they used to go from 360 to Xbox One Enhanced done the same with going from Xbox One to Series X, but I know that‚Äôs probably simplifying it too much.
